As part of the City’s goals of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, approximately 70% of the City’s vehicles run on some form of alternative fuel, including compressed natural gas (CNG), renewable liquefied natural gas (RLNG), renewable diesel, electricity, and propane. The remaining 30% of the City’s fleet runs on unleaded gasoline. Purchasing renewable natural gas (RNG) for the vehicles fueled by CNG would support the City’s long-term goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 because it would reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with these vehicles by 60% while reducing the City’s overall fleet emissions by 6%. Additionally, RNG qualifies as an advanced biofuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard. This means RNG fuel purchased by the City generates carbon credits (credits) which in turn can be sold or traded. Staff recommends registering and participating in the California Air Resources Board Low Carbon Fuel Standards carbon credit program and awarding an agreement with Clean Energy Renewable Fuels, LLC for the purchase of renewable natural gas and management of a Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program for an amount not to exceed $1,531,750 over a five-year period. ', ' ', 'Background', 'Beginning in 1998, the City began converting its heavy and medium duty vehicles to CNG. The Big Blue Bus has been purchasing renewable liquefied natural gas (RLNG) to fuel its 200 plus buses or 20% of the fleet since 2015 under an existing agreement with Clean Energy Fuels. Approximately 270 vehicles or 27% of the fleet currently run on CNG. RNG is fully interchangeable with CNG. It is harvested from methane captured at landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, and dairy and pig farms. It is 60% less carbon intensive compared to CNG sourced from non-renewable sources.', ' ', 'Low Carbon Fuel Standards – Carbon Credits', 'California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) mandates were enacted by executive order pursuant to the Global Warming Solutions Act, Assembly Bill 32, to reduce the carbon intensity in transportation fuels to 1990 levels by 2020. The carbon intensity of a fuel is the measure of its greenhouse gas emissions on a lifecycle basis and includes all emissions during extraction and refining, production and processing, and use in the vehicle. The LCFS Program is one of the measures adopted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) pursuant to Health and Safety Code Sections 38500-38599 to reduce greenhouse gases in California. To generate credits, fuels must have a lower carbon intensity than the target set by the CARB. Fuels with a carbon intensity higher than the standard would generate a deficit. Credit owners can sell or trade credits in the California LCFS market, thereby generating revenues. Credits generated through the LCFS Program can be banked without penalty over the course of the program. Presently, the City is not enrolled in the LCFS program and is not receiving any revenue from the sale of LCFS credits. Under the existing program, LCFS credits are generated based on the volume of fuel dispensed at a facility. With BBB’s contract for RLNG, Clean Energy dispenses the fuel at its facility prior to delivering it to the BBB yards. However, with RNG, the City would be dispensing the fuel at the City Yards. If Council approves the contract to replace the City’s current natural gas purchases with RNG, the City would be eligible to enroll in the LCFS program and able to generate LCFS credits. Potential revenues are estimated to generate approximately $120,000 annually. Estimated revenues are based on the number of carbon credits the City could potentially generate by converting to RNG and the current market value of those credits.', ' ', 'Discussion', 'Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), or biomethane, has been identified as a viable alternative to traditional natural gas. RNG has the same chemical composition as traditional natural gas, but has a low carbon intensity. The City currently purchases its natural gas from the local public utility Southern California Gas Company, which delivers the natural gas through two lines located at the City Municipal Yards, 2500 Michigan Avenue. The natural gas is then compressed on-site and stored at the City Municipal Yards prior to being dispensed to fuel the City’s CNG vehicles. Santa Monica currently dispenses and consumes approximately 370,000 (Therms) or 294,000 (Gas Gallon Equivalent) of natural gas annually.', ' ', 'If awarded, the City would purchase RNG from Clean Energy Renewable Fuels, LLC, which generates RNG from methane captured at landfills and wastewater treatment facilities, purifies the methane, compresses it, and sends it to the interstate fuel pipeline system accessed by the Southern California Gas Company. Clean Energy Renewable Fuels, LLC would register with CARB on behalf of the City to manage the LCFS Program and sell the credits on the City’s behalf to generate revenues based on the market value of the credits. By producing RNG, Clean Energy Renewable Fuels, LLC generates its own credits which it sells to generate revenues to operate its business. Clean Energy is able to guarantee price parity between Compressed Natural Gas and Renewable Natural Gas by passing on to its customers a portion of the revenue it generates from the sale of its own credits. Clean Energy Renewable Fuels, LLC would administer the LCFS Program on behalf of the City including tracking, registering, submitting reports, trading the credits, generating monthly revenue, and submitting checks to the City.

While this concept provided short-term contributions toward such community priorities as historic preservation, childcare facilities, traffic mitigation and cultural amenities, the perception that height and density rules were negotiable ultimately undermined the stability, predictability and transparency of the City’s development standards.  Since the adoption of the landmark Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) which is the heart of the City’s General Plan, the City has adopted an implementing citywide Zoning Code and Downtown Community Plan, along with other neighborhood and district specific plans.  Together, these standards govern the allowable heights, density and design rules for new development throughout Santa Monica, giving clear guidance to property owners, developers, nearby residents and the community at large.  By adopting those plans, the Council established firm and clear limits on the scope of future development. To give added assurance that these long-term plans will remain as the stable standards for new development for the foreseeable future, the majority of the Council has directed the development of a charter amendment that would require a supermajority of five voting members of the Council to approve any increase in the height and density standards contained in the adopted LUCE or the Downtown Community Plan for a fixed period of time (staff recommends no more than ten years).  Charter amendments must be submitted to the people for approval at a general municipal election.   ', 'Background', 'At the City Council meeting on December 12, 2017, the Council directed staff to “explore a possible 2018 ballot measure that would protect against development exceeding the adopted General Plan or Zoning Code limits on height or Floor Area Ratio (FAR), by requiring super-majority Council approval, or by other means, and return to Council with options.” On May 8, 2018 (Attachment B), the City Council considered various options for a ballot measure and directed staff to return with a resolution placing a measure on the November 6, 2018 ballot that would require a super-majority Council vote for any amendments to the LUCE or DCP that result in an increase to allowed heights or floor area ratios.', 'Discussion', 'As directed by City Council, the attached resolution would place a measure on the November 6, 2018 ballot that would require five affirmative votes of the Council for any amendments to the LUCE or DCP that result in an increase in the maximum allowed height or FAR for the highest Tier in any land use designation. The LUCE contains maximum heights and FARs for most areas of the City except the Downtown area (which is covered by the DCP), the Hospital Area Specific Plan (HASP) area and the Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) area.  The HASP and CCSP are both referenced in the LUCE as the guiding documents on development standards such as height and FAR. ', 'Council Actions to Increase Height and FAR that Would Not Require Super-Majority', 'The sections below provide clarity as to Council actions, including those that would not require the affirmative vote of five Council Members, particularly in relation to the Zoning Ordinance and each of the areas of the City covered by existing or proposed specific plans.', '·         Downtown Community Plan', 'The LUCE states that, “Prior to the completion of a new Downtown Specific Plan, the existing Bayside District Specific Plan and applicable land use designations will apply.”  The Downtown Community Plan was adopted on July 25, 2017 and established development standards including maximum allowable height and FAR for the Downtown area.  An Established Large Sites Overlay was also created in DCP Section 9.10.080 that required three sites within the Overlay to be processed through a development agreement and comply with an absolute height limit of 130’ and maximum FAR particular to each site. As long as any Established Large Sites Overlay project complies with DCP Section 9.10.080, the proposed ballot measure would not require a super-majority vote of Council because they would not require an amendment to the DCP.', '·         Zoning Ordinance Amendments', 'There are areas of the City where the height and FAR standards in the LUCE exceed the standards in the Zoning Ordinance, such as the Mixed Use Boulevard Low District and portions of the Bergamot Area Plan. In such cases, an applicant could request and the City could process a Development Agreement to allow a project that exceeds the Zoning Ordinance standards but is consistent with the standards in the LUCE.  Conversely, an applicant or the City could propose zoning amendments that modify height and FAR that remain within LUCE maximum allowable height and FAR.  Under the proposed ballot measure, such projects would not require a super-majority vote of Council because they would not require an amendment to the LUCE.', '·         Bergamot Area Plan (BAP)', 'Similar to the Zoning Ordinance, the BAP contains height and FAR standards that in some cases are less than what is allowed in the LUCE. The proposed ballot measure would not impose a super-majority requirement for a project or amendments that exceed the height and FAR standards contained in the BAP as long as the project or amendments are within the Tier 3 maximum allowable height and FAR standards in the LUCE.', '·         Hospital Area Specific Plan (HASP)', 'The LUCE does not contain height and FAR standards for the HASP area but it incorporates the standards of the HASP by reference and states that: “Development standards within the Healthcare Mixed-Use District are as established within the HASP”. While the HASP contains height and FAR standards for most areas within the HASP area, it defers the development standards for Providence Saint John’s Health Center (PSJHC) to the Saint John’s Development Agreement.  However, given the fact that the HASP area includes the Santa Monica UCLA Medical Center, PSJHC campus, and the areas in between, it is unlikely that there would be a proposal to increase the height or FAR in the areas covered by the HASP. This is because development on the UCLA Medical Center campus is exempt from the City’s standards and PSJHC standards are to be established through a Development Agreement.  As a result, no LUCE amendment would be necessary and the proposed ballot measure would not require a super-majority vote of Council to amend the HASP to increase the allowed height and FAR.', '·         Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP)', 'Development standards for property within the Civic Center area are governed by the CCSP. The LUCE states that: “The Civic Center Specific Plan prescribes the allowable uses within this district”; and “The Civic Center Specific Plan establishes allowable building heights and intensity”. The Civic Center area is predominantly built-out and the only remaining unentitled portion of the CCSP is the Civic Auditorium.  As a result, it is unlikely that there would be a request to increase the maximum allowed height or FAR in the CCSP unless undertaken as part of future proposals for reactivating the Civic Auditorium.  As proposed, the ballot measure would not require a super-majority vote of Council to amend the CCSP to increase the allowed height or FAR.', '·         Memorial Park Neighborhood Plan', 'The Memorial Park Neighborhood Plan (MPNP) is currently underway. The LUCE and Zoning Ordinance contain development standards including height and FAR for all areas within the MPNP area and it is not anticipated that the Plan will increase the maximum allowable height or FAR. However, if the Plan did include increases to maximum allowable height or FAR for the highest LUCE Tier under the proposed ballot measure, the approval of the MPNP would require a super-majority vote of the Council.', '·         Santa Monica Business Park', 'The LUCE currently contains height and FAR standards for the area of the Santa Monica Business Park. Furthermore, the LUCE states that “In the Airport Business Park, a Specific Plan is required before significant new development may occur”. Based on the proposed ballot measure, if a new Santa Monica Business Park Specific Plan includes heights or FARs that exceed the ones currently contained in the LUCE, approval of the Specific Plan would require a super-majority vote of the Council.', '100% Affordable Housing Exemption', 'The proposed ballot measure includes an exemption for amendments to maximum height and FAR for the LUCE and DCP for 100% affordable housing projects.

This date would be ten years after adoption if the Council places the measure on the ballot and it receives approval from a majority of the voters in the November general municipal election.  Both the LUCE and the Downtown Plan were prepared as long-range plans to provide guidance to approximately the year 2030.  A ten-year sunset of this charter amendment would give future Councils and voters the opportunity to revisit the issue as a new citywide planning framework is developed a decade from now to anticipate the changed circumstances of time.

The resolution to place a measure on the November 6, 2018 ballot proposes a procedural change to Council actions necessary to enact future amendments that would increase maximum height and FAR in the LUCE or DCP.  Any future amendments to maximum height and FAR in the LUCE or DCP would require their own environmental analysis.  The proposed procedural change to require five affirmative votes instead of a simple majority for such amendments would not allow more mass or floor area within the LUCE or DCP than existing regulations.

Stewardship of these public assets has long involved leases and concessions granted to private businesses that offer food services.  The City has a strong proprietary interest in protecting $4.5 million in annual lease revenues on its 27 food-service leaseholds (City Tenants). Current labor-peace provisions in the City’s leasing and licensing guidelines (Leasing Guidelines) for the Downtown and Pier are intended to minimize disruption to the City’s revenue stream arising from potential labor conflicts. At the direction of Council, for the past two years, staff has explored the inclusion in the Leasing Guidelines of a requirement that tenants execute a labor-peace agreement (LPA), an agreement between an employer and a labor organization which generally involves the labor organization giving up the right to strike or otherwise disrupt the business’s operations in exchange for negotiated provisions that strengthen workers’ rights to organize.', ' ', 'Community and Council debate identified tensions and challenges inherent in balancing the Council’s desire to both support the ability of locally owned small businesses to maintain and compete for City leasing opportunities and provide strong protections for stable revenue from those leases.  Staff has analyzed the legal, financial, and policy considerations of Council’s direction and concluded that, given the difficulties of balancing these interests, the most feasible model may be the long-established LPA policy that provides a comprehensive process for compliance and enforcement at the San Francisco International Airport (SFO). If Council determines that the SFO model (or some close variation) meets its goals, staff recommends employing a hearing officer to make determinations regarding procedural disputes and the application of the terms of the LPA, using a template to clarify and streamline the LPA process, and determining thresholds for certain exemptions to the LPA policy. Based on direction received, staff would return to Council with corresponding amendments to the City’s Leasing Guidelines and policies. On the other hand, if the Council concludes that the SFO model does not meet its goals, given the thorough and lengthy effort to find an acceptable alternative model, staff recommends leaving the current LPA language in the Leasing Guidelines unchanged.   ', ' ', 'Background', 'Consideration of strengthening the current LPA provisions of the Leasing Guidelines originally surfaced in discussions around the extension of the lease for the Spitfire Grill at the Santa Monica Airport (SMO) in 2016.  Since that time, Council and staff have sought to find a workable model that effectively addresses the multiple objectives involved.  ', ' ', 'After more than a year of discussions regarding the LPA model used at Los Angeles International Airport, on October 24, 2017, Council held a study session to discuss whether the City’s Leasing Guidelines and policies for City-owned properties with food-service operations should require labor-peace agreements (see Attachment A).  Staff provided an overview of the key elements of a labor-peace agreement (LPA) and Council provided the following direction:', '·         Develop a policy, similar to the requirement adopted by the Santa Monica-Malibu School District (School District) for a School District-owned hospitality property, that would require an LPA with a no-strike pledge and identify a non-political body that would determine whether a labor organization’s LPA requirements are arbitrary or capricious.', '·         Consider ways to reduce the time and cost for businesses to negotiate an LPA, including whether an LPA template could be used.', '·         Evaluate the use of exemptions or thresholds to minimize impacts to small businesses. ', '·         Exempt food-service carts and outdoor-dining licenses from an LPA requirement.', ' ', ' ', 'Discussion', 'As outlined in greater detail in the June 12, 2018, Council Information Item (Attachment B) staff has analyzed whether a workable policy can be based on the School District’s requirement, which applies to only one operator—the Doubletree Hotel—that includes food services.  While that lease has a provision to address the potential that a labor organization could insist on “arbitrary or capricious conditions,” that term is not clearly defined in the School District’s policy. Since its adoption in 2005, the Board of Education has not had to determine any claims of arbitrary or capricious conditions. Because of its lack of a clear definition and with no record of determinations to assess best practices, the School District policy does not appear to provide a sound basis for fulfilling the objectives of the Council’s direction.', ' ', 'Another aspect of the Council’s direction was to examine whether a “template” for the provisions of an LPA could give further clarity to what might be termed as “arbitrary and capricious.”  Unfortunately, the more prescriptive such a template might be, the more it resembles local government regulation of labor relations (which is pre-empted by Federal law) and the less it resembles voluntary good faith bargaining between two parties to preclude workplace disruptions.  ', ' ', 'To address this challenge, research done by the City Attorney’s Office identified the SFO model -- which bypasses the challenges involved in imposing a template.  Instead, it offers a “default.”  To protect its proprietary interests and to avoid labor disputes at the Airport, SFO has utilized a Model Card Check Agreement in its labor peace agreement procedures (see Attachment C for the resolution adopting labor peace/card check rule and Attachment D for the model card check agreement template at SFO).  As an alternative to an appeal process to assess what might be deemed “arbitrary and capricious”, a model card check agreement is an option that could provide a more streamlined LPA negotiation process, potentially minimizing expenses for prospective food-service operators and labor organizations. In the SFO model, the LPA process requires the employer to enter into a Labor Peace/Card Check Agreement within 30 days of a labor organization’s request. In the event the labor organization and the employer are unable to negotiate an agreement within the 30-day period, the parties are then bound by the Model Card Check Agreement. Attachment E is a general fact sheet on Card Check.', 'While Card Check is a long-established procedure for avoiding protracted and even bitter disputes over rights to representation by workers, it is certainly not without its drawbacks.  Its primary advantage is that workers have the opportunity to privately express their support for labor organization representation with less fear of retaliatory action by their employer.  The primary criticism levelled against this procedure is that, unlike a secret ballot election, critics argue that individuals may be duped or coerced into signing their support for labor organization representation.  Given the contentious debate over these trade-offs, this report does not attempt to provide detailed objective analysis of the pros and cons of the Card Check procedure other than to note that it has been in place for nearly two decades at SFO – while acknowledging there are significant differences between the concessions at an international airport and those embedded in our community at the Pier, SMO, the Third Street Promenade and the Santa Monica beach.  ', ' ', ' ', 'Council expressed preference for an impartial, non-political entity to address LPA disputes. In the SFO model, if a dispute arises over procedural issues or the interpretation or application of the terms of the Model Labor Peace/Card Agreement, the parties submit their concerns or claims to an arbitrator, with costs shared equally between the food-service operator and labor organization. For complaints involving a violation, breach, or exemption of an LPA agreement, the SFO model designates the Airport Director or designee to investigate. ', ' ', 'The process in Santa Monica could be established similarly, with investigatory duties assigned to staff.  As at SFO, the City could use a City-appointed hearing officer. Various state and local laws provide for appeals of citations or City decisions to appointed hearing officers.  A hearing officer is an independent arbitrator of facts and law for resolution of a wide range of disputes or citations, including code compliance, business license, personnel matters, and airport citations.  As outlined in Attachment F, the overhead and fees associated with arbitration providers such as American Arbitration Association, Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., and Alternative Dispute Resolution Services, Inc. can vary widely. The City Attorney’s Office and the City’s Rent Control Board use hearing officers to issue determinations on a variety of matters. Currently, the costs of hearing officers are borne by the City at approximately $112 per hour.  If there is an interest in expanding the use of hearing officers to resolve disputes between private parties during the course of negotiating an LPA, Council, in its discretion, could elect to allocate the costs of the hearing officer between the parties or to bear such costs. ', ' ', 'Thresholds', 'In addition to seeking a model policy regarding LPAs, Council expressed interest in establishing thresholds to address concerns regarding the potential disproportional cost burden on small businesses related to an LPA requirement.  As noted in the Information Item, there is no single definition of small business, as eligibility thresholds are industry- and context-specific. ', ' ', 'One threshold option would be the number of employees. The City does not currently require food-service operators to report the number of employees. However, establishing an exemption for businesses with 25 or fewer employees would align with the City’s minimum wage ordinance, which defines a small business as having 25 or fewer employees. There are other federal laws that apply thresholds for exemption based upon the number of employees and number of calendar weeks worked during a specific period. Under the Affordable Care Act, employers with 50 or more full-time-equivalent employees are considered large employers.  The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 exempt firms that employ fewer than 15 employees each working day for 20 calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year. ', ' ', 'Another threshold option would be gross sales. The City does not currently require food- service operators to report gross sales unless their lease includes a percentage rent provision. However, there are several examples of gross sales as the threshold for exemption. Under the Fair Labor Act, firms with gross sales under $500,000 are exempt from regulation. The Small Business Administration classifies a small business as any non-manufacturing businesses with less than $7.5 million in annual receipts. The Department of Energy (DOE) may allow for temporary exemptions for manufacturers of consumer products with annual gross revenues not exceeding $8 million from all operations. ', ' ', 'Council may wish to affirm that the LPA requirement applies only to City-owned properties that are subject to new leases/license agreements or substantial modifications of those agreements. The current definition of substantial modification as defined in the Santa Monica Pier and Downtown Leasing Guidelines is: (i) a change of use of the property, (ii) increase in seating or square footage of more than 25%; or (iii) an extension of lease duration. Confining the application of LPA to City-owned properties would exempt City-administered leases on the State-owned beach.', '   ', 'Alternatives', 'Council may also consider the following alternatives:', '·         Keep Existing Labor Peace Provisions As-Is:  Council could maintain the existing labor-peace provisions given that; (1)  the existing labor-peace provisions in the Leasing Guidelines currently prohibit city tenants from engaging in practices that impede employees’ ability to organize and contract with a labor organization for the purpose of collective bargaining; (2) the City has not experienced work stoppages at any of the city’s leasehold properties; and (3) the impacts of LPAs on rental income and small businesses is unknown and unpredictable at this time.', ' ', '·         Expand the Financial Obligations of Food-Service Operators: Council could eliminate the use of percentage rent formulas in lease agreements and seek higher base rents to avoid fluctuations in revenues and minimize impacts from labor issues.  Higher base rents, however, may reduce the interest of potential food-service operators in pursuing City leases or licenses. ', ' ', 'Next Steps', 'If the Council supports the SFO model, staff would return with appropriate changes (including any thresholds imposed on its applicability) to the Leasing Guidelines for Council adoption.  If the alternative is to expand the financial obligations of food-service operators, staff would work to further develop that alternative for future Council consideration.  If the alternative chosen is not to proceed with the SFO model or expanding the financial obligations of food service operators, no further action is required.', ' ', 'Financial Impacts and Budget Actions', 'There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of the recommended actions.

In a time of a new gubernatorial administration set to take office in Sacramento and a national administration challenging many of the City’s long-standing approaches to social and environmental issues, the need for active and effective partners to work with State and Federal legislators and agencies is self-evident.

Given the City’s investment of staff time and consultant resources to integrate InterMed’s bill review platform into the City’s workers’ compensation claims management system and the advantageous pricing InterMed has offered during the extension period, it is prudent to exercise a longer contract.

System installation and testing coincided with the expiration of InterMed’s bill review agreement, and the extension gave staff the opportunity to complete the system installation using a familiar and proven bill review system.

This is critical, as the bill review process saves the City millions of dollars each year; and ', ' ', '·         Based on the City’s recent experience with integrating InterMed’s bill review platform into the new claims management system, it would take several hundred hours to install, test, and train staff on a new bill review system.

InterMed subsequently agreed and proposed raising its “per bill” fee 3% in the first year (a 31-cent increase per bill), a 2.5% increase in the second year, and 2.4% increase in the third and fourth years of the contract extension. Staff believes this represents competitive pricing based on a recent request for proposals the City issued for workers’ compensation claims management third party administrator services (which included a bill review component) and discussions with the City’s workers’ compensation consultant. Based on this pricing, staff estimates InterMed’s compensation for bill review services would increase by $100,000 over the four-year contract extension.

(Bird) scooters in Santa Monica in late 2017 and the introduction of Lime e-bikes in 2018. These small electric or human-powered devices are new and highly visible, drawing considerable attention and controversy when they arrive in any area. They have raised significant community concerns about safety and enforcement, including concerns about users riding on the sidewalk, doubling up on scooters, and riding without a helmet, all of which are prohibited under state and/or local laws; users failing to observe traffic controls in violation of the California Vehicle Code; and other unsafe or uncivil rider behaviors. The devices have also posed new challenges in managing the safe public use of the street, sidewalk, and beach. ', ' ', 'Rules and procedures to manage this disruption effectively are nascent at best. The City of Seattle has one of the “oldest” permitting systems, a pilot program less than one year old. Santa Monica focused first on implementing education strategies and on enforcing the laws concerning electric scooters. In response to actions by the City, Bird began helmet giveaways, applied safety information stickers to each device, and implemented driver’s license verification and photo-based parking confirmation. On March 6, 2018, Council adopted an emergency ordinance that established an impound fee for shared mobility devices that pose a hazard in the public right of way (PROW) and also directed staff to develop a pilot regulatory framework to work through the rules and procedures for effective management. Meanwhile, the Police Department has been actively enforcing laws, including conducting 623 stops and issuing 302 citations in the first three months of 2018, and over 809 stops and issuing 366 citations in the month of May.', ' ', 'Like the earlier arrival of ride-hailing (or transportation networking companies) like Uber and Lyft, these new mobility options are causing significant upheaval as well as shifts in travel behavior nationwide. Public agencies have struggled to get out ahead of venture-capital-funded disruptive technologies for which existing regulations are either inapplicable, inadequate or inappropriate.  To respond effectively to new approaches to mobility we need new approaches to how companies and technologies are regulated to protect public safety and promote wellbeing, sustainability and equity.', ' ', 'Santa Monica is a desirable market for new shared mobility options because of the diversity of people and activities citywide, the high-quality street network, and the culture of active and outdoor living. Shared mobility devices provide an option to move without a car, reduce pressure on vehicle lanes and parking spaces, and increase overall access and mobility. Low emissions options also facilitate Sustainable City goals and improved local air quality. In addition to hearing from hundreds of community members raising support for and concern about the devices, staff interviewed twelve dockless scooter and bike sharing companies in May 2018 to assess capacity and willingness to work in partnership with City staff, and operational characteristics of their systems. All of the companies expressed interest in launching operations in Santa Monica. ', ' ', 'The City has issued Bird Rides and Lime conditional vending permits to operate from private property. Vending permits are annual, with renewals based on the fiscal year calendar, so that the existing permits would expire or be renewed after June 30, 2018. Currently, Santa Monica has no regulatory or administrative system to manage dockless scooters and commercial bike shares operating in the PROW. Pursuant to Council direction, this report recommends that Santa Monica initiate a 16-month pilot program to forge a model way for regulating these new companies and technologies to protect public safety and promote community wellbeing, sustainability and equity. ', ' ', 'A pilot would facilitate the development of tools in a quickly changing environment and provide flexibility to solve new challenges. It is anticipated that administrative rules of the program will remain fluid during the pilot program as the City works with operators to define effective solutions and where necessary, impose appropriate rules and restrictions. Participation in the pilot program would be through a request for application and selection process. ', ' ', 'The proposed pilot program would:', '·              allow a limited number of devices run by up to three service providers, with staff recommending an initial cap of 1,500 devices with the potential to increase to a maximum of 2,250 devices during the program duration through the end of 2019.', '·              establish minimum operating requirements in the categories of maintenance, education, safety, customer service, data sharing and insurance/indemnification. ', '·              identify a broader list of recommended program components through which partners could be evaluated during the pilot term. ', ' ', 'A key to the program’s success would be an open and productive partnership between the City and operators that facilitates the operator being highly responsive to real community concerns about safety and adverse impacts on members of the public who walk, bike or drive in Santa Monica. The pilot program would be established by Ordinance, which would authorize staff to make adjustments to the program through Administrative Rules, and to evaluate performance of operators against the recommended program components. ', ' ', 'Cities large and small are responding to the rapid appearance of shared mobility devices. Responses have varied significantly based on local context, policy and regulatory structures. San Francisco, Austin and Chicago have been developing management systems and extensive rules. In contrast, Dallas invited unlimited providers without a regulatory framework, and received a flood of bicycles. Santa Monica’s approach seeks to balance the desire to welcome new technology and innovation with protecting public health, safety, wellbeing, and the value of the City’s PROW. ', ' ', 'The approach recommended by staff is to respond to disruption with neither heavy-handed efforts to stifle these new alternatives, nor a hands-off approach that ignores the very real problems their introduction has spawned.  Rather, the pilot is designed to collaboratively and flexibly develop an effective model to adequately regulate these new transportations options to ensure effective compliance with applicable State and local laws and especially to promote the health, safety and wellbeing of everyone in the community,  This does not deter the City from issuing citations to individual violators of the California Vehicle Code, nor preclude ongoing educational efforts to promote responsible behavior from all who share our city streets.  Instead, the pilot proposal is designed to directly address the new and very real challenges posed by the introduction of large numbers of new mobility devices.  Staff believes this approach is consistent with the Council’s Strategic Goal of promoting a new model of mobility for Santa Monica and the Council’s adoption of Vision Zero to eliminate deaths and serious injuries from roadway collisions. ', ' ', 'While staff establishes the new pilot program, solicits applications, and selects the pilot program operators, staff proposes an emergency ordinance that would limit the term of any Fiscal Year 2018/19 Vendor Permits issued to companies to rent Shared Mobility Devices on private property to September 16, 2018, with a possible extension of up to 90 days. This limited term renewal is necessary to facilitate the orderly and timely transition into the pilot. ', ' ', 'Background', ' ', 'On February 27, 2018, Council received an update on the Mobility Strategic Goal and discussed efforts toward achieving the three targets of: ', '1)               Increasing trips by walking, biking and transit; ', '2)               Eliminating severe injuries and fatalities from traffic collisions; and ', '3)               Creating a complete and connected network of transportation.  ', 'Facilitating ways to get around that are convenient, comfortable, and affordable is a component of the broad third target. This target incorporates shared mobility and customer-focused solutions that meet diverse users and use cases, among other topics. Technology-driven shared mobility solutions are posing new challenges and opportunities, and increasing the speed of transportation change substantially. The Council report presented areas of potential opportunity, and shorter-term actions that could optimize community benefit during changing conditions. The staff report included principles to guide decision-making in this time of rapid change, grounded in the values from adopted policy documents: ', '·              Put people and safety first.  ', '·              Give all people access to mobility choices.   ', '·              Pioneer a clean mobility future.  ', '·              Design great streets for health and wellbeing.   ', '·              Leverage private sector innovation in new mobility that serves community needs. ', '·              Strengthen government services with data-driven decision-making.   ', 'Council supported information from the report, and directed staff to proceed with identified short term physical projects, programs, and innovation exploration.  ', ' ', "On July 6, 2010, Council adopted the Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE), the heart of the State-mandated General Plan that sets the City's broad transportation policy foundation. It identified policies to create a safe street network that encourages all modes of transportation that are accessible to users regardless of their age or ability, and encouraged diverse modes of transportation and programs which get people to use them. Since the adoption of the LUCE, staff has pursued many elements that help people be more equipped, aware, and using transportation options:   ", '·              Installation of a 100+ mile bike facility network that connects to neighborhood destinations, schools, and commercial areas as outlined in the Bike Action Plan;', '·              Construction of improvements to make streets more “complete” (serving more types of users with greater levels of safety) like Ocean Park Boulevard, Samohi Safe Routes to School, Michigan Avenue Neighborhood Greenway, Berkeley Street traffic calming, and the Colorado Esplanade; ', '·              Launching Breeze Bike Share in November 2015 with 500 GPS-enabled “smart bikes” and 86 stations. To date Breeze has enabled over 650,000 rides in a way that has produced approximately $350,000 net revenue that has benefited the mobility goals of the City; ', '·              Welcoming the Expo Light Rail in May 2016 with three Santa Monica stations, and first/last mile connections through Evolution of Blue rerouting, Blue at Night and many crossing and access improvements; ', '·              Implementing the new Transportation Demand Management Ordinance (TDM) in January 2016 that required employers over 30 and development over 7,500 square feet or 16 residential units to do trip reduction strategies; ', '·              Adopting the Downtown Community Plan in July 2017 that prioritized pedestrian safety, expanding transportation options, creating complete streets, and incorporating new technologies into our transportation system. ', ' ', 'Breeze Bike Share riders recently pedaled past the 1.5 million mile mark, with over 40% of rides by Santa Monica residents. The Breeze system consists of clusters of bike racks that are identified as “stations” in system software. Bikes are equipped with locks that can attach to any bike rack; bikes can be located using the mobile app. Breeze bikes were purchased with grant funds, are owned by the City, and operate under contract by CycleHop LLC. The Santa Monica Municipal Code was amended in August 2015 to enable Breeze Bike Share operations in the public right-of-way in SMMC Chapter 3.20. This code section prohibits the operation of non-public bike share in the PROW.', ' ', 'Around September 2017, Bird began offering shared electric scooters in Santa Monica, without a City business license. The Bird system places scooters out each morning, and collects them at night for charging. The scooters are seen regularly on City streets and sidewalks, including being parking in locations that often obstruct pedestrians and sidewalk access. Currently, Bird has a City-issued Business License and Vending Permit to offer its scooters on private property with conditions on its operations, particularly as they relate to scooters being placed in the PROW. Since Bird began operating, many companies have inquired about the potential to operate in Santa Monica, and some have begun operating including Lime. ', ' ', 'On March 6, 2018, Council adopted an emergency ordinance that established an impound fee for shared mobility devices that pose a hazard in the public right of way, among other enforcement-related provisions. Council also directed staff to develop a pilot regulatory framework to facilitate the development of effective management tools for shared mobility devices to operate lawfully and safely in Santa Monica. ', ' ', 'Discussion', 'The world has experienced an explosion of transportation change driven by global investment in new mobility approaches fueled by billions of dollars of venture capital financing. In addition to smaller app-based start-ups, large companies like Google/Alphabet are investing in transportation systems and software, and traditional equipment manufacturers like Ford are developing new vehicles and partnerships with other device operators. The worldwide introduction of rideshare/transportation network companies has decimated the taxi industry and launched tectonic shifts in consumer travel behavior.  Change in the marketplace is easily outpacing the development of regulatory structures at all levels of government. ', ' ', 'Santa Monica is at the epicenter of these trends.  With worsening traffic, the extension of the Expo Line to Santa Monica (in the context of an historic expansion of rail transit in Los Angeles County), the evolution of the Big Blue Bus system and the introduction of the first “bike sharing” system in the region, Santa Monica is at the cutting edge of creating a new model of mobility. In terms of private investment, Santa Monica is experiencing the sea change in travel modes most immediately in shared mobility such as “dockless” or “free-floating” bike share and scooter share. While many residents have eagerly embraced the new options, many others have expressed outrage and frustration about safety and enforcement following the arrival of Bird scooters, including reckless rider behavior and careless device parking. The systems have posed new challenges in managing the safe public use of the limited space on our streets, sidewalks, and beach paths. Additionally, the systems raised new issues regarding commercial use of the public right-of-way, responsibilities for complaint resolution, data sharing, liability, and the resources needed for program oversight.', ' ', 'Rules and procedures to effectively manage this disruption are nascent at best. This challenge is not unique to mobility options.  In recent years, for example, Santa Monica has faced a number of such issues, including how to respond to the rise of home sharing companies as well as whether to allow uses of the public right of way for outdoor dining or public “parklets.”  Experience has shown that pilot programs offer a framework to experiment to find the best ways to shape and fine tune a regulatory approach that addresses the dynamic impact of market forces and changing public attitudes and consumer choices.', ' ', 'Santa Monica staff are actively working on the issues, with a first focus on both education and enforcement. Following concerns raised by the City, Bird initiated helmet giveaways, posted safe operating rules on each device, and implemented driver’s license verification. Meanwhile, the Police Department has been actively enforcing laws, including conducting over 1,400 stops and issuing over 600 citations so far in 2018. Pursuant to Council direction, staff is now bringing forward a proposal for a pilot program that would enable the development of long-term regulations to effectively manage these systems in the PROW. The proposal is informed by hundreds of community conversations, as well as review of best practices, and interviews with a dozen operators.  ', ' ', 'Creating a more diverse, convenient, comfortable, and affordable transportation system is a core component of the Mobility Strategic Goal, and creating a “new model of mobility.” New options can help to meet a wide range of user needs and situations, making it easier to get around with or without a car. Electric bikes and electric scooters are among these new options, and can reduce pressure on vehicle lanes and parking spaces, while increasing overall access and mobility. These low emissions options also facilitate Sustainable City goals and improved local air quality. The emergence of shared electric devices is more recent, enabled by GPS communications and lower-cost device manufacturing, and is creating a new mobility service model.  ', ' ', 'Santa Monica is a desirable market for new shared mobility options because of the diversity of people and activities citywide, the high-quality street network, and the culture of active and outdoor living. This creates the conditions for high device utilization on the City’s built network of streets and bike lanes by residents, employees and visitors. This high demand necessitates development of management tools that address community concerns and the need to reinforce orderly use of the PROW and safe, civil travel behavior. ', ' ', 'Minimum system requirements would be established in the pilot, with recommended system elements used to evaluate operator performance and partnership. A set of supporting Administrative Regulations would remain fluid during the pilot program as the City works with operators on methods to reduce PROW blockage and sidewalk clutter, to educate users, to evaluate utilization data, and to reduce public enforcement burden. Participation in the pilot program would be through a request for application and selection process. Details of the pilot program are described in more detail below.  ', ' ', 'Engaging with Shared Mobility', 'The introduction and quick adoption of Bird scooters demonstrated that users are willing to try new mobility options. Enabling different services to be responsibly tested and operated in Santa Monica would create a diversity of options that would meet a wider range of user needs, and help the City meet goals of reducing congestion and emissions by limiting the number of short trips taken in cars and improving the first/last mile connections to transit. Further, the wave of private investment into the shared mobility industry would enable Santa Monica to expand mobility options without incurring the expense of operating its own service. ', ' ', 'In recent months, Santa Monica has experienced many of the common issues associated with shared mobility devices. The City has received hundreds of community complaints regarding Bird, focused on both their parking/PROW issues (discarded Bird Scooters blocking sidewalks, curb ramps, ADA access, doorways, and the congested beach bike path) and user operation/safety issues (riding on the sidewalks, speed, lack of helmet use, near misses and collisions). Although Bird Scooters fit the definition of a “motorized scooter” as defined in Section 407.5 of the California Vehicle Code (which requires riders of motorized scooters to wear a helmet and be a licensed driver, and prohibits riding on the sidewalk), the rules and etiquette for how to operate and park some new devices are not clear to users.  ', ' ', 'To date over 30 cities across the country have launched dockless bike share or scooter pilots to engage with this rapidly changing environment. Although these pilot programs range greatly in scope, term, requirements, and resources, there are similarities such as:', '·         Safety requirements: front and rear lights, brakes, maximum operating speed, regular device maintenance, and clearly marked device identification number. ', '·         System size: total device minimum and maximum, with variations in the ability to scale up or down.     ', '·         Community outreach: minimum safety education through events or digital resources, working with local groups. ', '·         Operations: remove inoperable devices or safety hazards promptly, rebalance to provide equitable coverage and avoid over-concentration, and provide adequate staffing. ', '·         Parking: defined local parking requirements, sometimes with “lock-to” requirement.', '·         Customer service: clearly posted customer support contact, available on-demand services, and prompt response to complaints. ', '·         Data sharing: weekly or monthly data sharing, some require API access.  ', '·         Insurance/Liability: maintain insurance coverage to specified limits, and indemnify local agencies. ', ' ', 'Attachment A provides more information about the emergence of shared mobility and select city approaches. Overall, cities are working to reorganize for new work demands, and develop the new tools need to deal with the myriad data, communications, regulation, operation and maintenance associated with citywide programs.', ' ', 'Why create a pilot program?', 'In light of the rapid changes going on in mobility right now, approaching shared mobility regulation as a pilot program would enable the City to: ', '·              Develop a new area of policy, regulation, and enforcement through firsthand experience', '·              Move quickly to adapt to a rapidly changing industry, but leave room to learn and adjust as appropriate', '·              Test new device and service providers in a growing industry ', '·              Explore partnership models with private companies ', '·              Explore possibilities for data capture, structures, and utilization for the purpose of advancing the new model of mobility. ', '·              Allow the City time to experiment with different management tools (e.g. “Geo-fencing” and creation of shared mobility device drop zones)', 'After the launch of Bird, staff convened a working group of staff members from the departments of Planning and Community Development, Public Works, Police, Community and Cultural Services, Office of Sustainability and the Environment, City Manager, and City Attorney to understand how the introduction of shared mobility devices are impacting all aspects of the City operations and PROW.

', ' ', 'Anticipated Outcomes of the Pilot Program on Breeze Bike Share', 'At the same time as Bird’s launch in September 2017, Breeze Bikes on average had been ridden 2,500 - 3,000 miles each and began to show considerable wear and tear, which meant that more bikes were out for repair often, and more parts like bike controllers (GPS computers) needed repair or replacements. With the launch of Bird Scooters, users had more and newer options. Because of both of these factors Breeze Bike Share has seen an average 10 percent decline in monthly ridership since September over the previous year, and staff anticipates that trend to continue in the near term with the introduction of more and different options. In spite of the decline, several agencies including LA Metro, are reinvesting in their publicly owned bike share systems because of the dynamic and unpredictable nature of commercial systems. Public agencies cannot guarantee any services when provided by permit and value the ability to provide consistent services to the public. Because Breeze has operated without public subsidy for over 2 years, funds exist for reinvestment in the program. Council may consider expanding and/or improving the Breeze fleet to ensure this stable and high-quality option continues to exist for users.  ', ' ', 'Possible Pilot Program Modifications', '·              Use of Public Property Charge: The pilot currently anticipates a cost recovery fee for staff time to administer the pilot program. To the extent these vehicles operate in the PROW, the public right of way land is a valuable asset, designed primarily for the movement of people, goods and related activities. The City implements charges for commercial use of the PROW such as outdoor dining, which is subject to a regulatory fee that recoups processing fees, and a Use of Public Property charge. Since these companies generate considerable private income, a similar approach could be used for shared mobility devices, as they are made available for commercial transactions on the PROW. Bird has publicly floated support for a charge per vehicle per day that could support improvement of bike lanes, education and other beneficial public investments. Council could direct staff to return with the supporting legal research and documentation for a use of public property charge prior to the implementation of the pilot program in September.', '·              Device Type and Quantity Limits: Staff anticipates that the initial introduction of 1,500 devices, with the possibility to expand the program to 2,250 devices, will sufficiently serve mobility needs of the community for the term of the pilot while limiting the disruption of devices on the PROW.  Council may consider broadening the scope of the pilot program to allow for more (or fewer) devices and to include regular human powered bikes as well. However, based on conversation with other cities, staff anticipates that a broadened scope would result in more community complaints and concerns. Additionally, the allowance of more devices would require more resources for program oversight, enforcement, and response to comments.', '·              Operators Cap: Council may consider opening the pilot program to more than three operators. Other cities have experienced the challenge of playing the role of “referee” between competing operators. This challenge has required more staff resources to appropriately administer their programs. Additionally, more options may not equate to more and better options, and having multiple companies operating on different platforms can lead to user confusion. For instance, after the introduction LimeBike, the Breeze Bike Share customer service team has begun to receive multiple calls from customers who mistook LimeBikes for Breeze Bikes. For these reasons, Staff recommends capping the number of operators permitted under the pilot program to three.', '·              “Lock-to” Minimum Requirement: Some shared mobility devices (like Jump e-bikes and Zagster Bikes) enable the user to lock the device to a stationary object like a bike rack. Staff anticipates that this form of locking mechanism could help reduce the number of devices left precariously in the PROW, and help guide users to lock the devices in appropriate locations like the “furniture zone” on sidewalks. Council may consider requiring shared mobility operators to provide “lock-to” devices as part of the pilot program. ', '·              Education Minimum Requirements: Staff recommends that shared mobility operators provide riding rules and etiquette information to users upon sign-up and on the individual devices. Council may consider requiring the operators to take a more active role in educating users about the rules and etiquette by providing regular education awareness events and campaigns, holding helmet giveaways, or establishing good/bad behavior incentives or penalties. Such programs could help in more quickly educating the public about the new options as well as reducing bad user behavior. ', ' ', 'Staffing Requirements for Pilot Program', 'In order to allow shared mobility devices to operate in the PROW while ensuring public safety and access for all users, adequate staffing is needed. This is a brand new program similar to home-sharing that does not fit into existing city functions or resources. Staff anticipates that the introduction of three companies and up to 2,250 shared mobility devices will require significant oversight, education, data collection/analysis, and enforcement. Meeting Council direction to engage with operators through a partnership approach will require additional program coordination. Staff recommends a full time program coordinator and an enforcement officer liaison for the duration of the pilot program. For this limited term, resources were identified from an existing vacant position, and through contracting out a portion of development plan check functions of the Mobility Division.

Fees would pay for the additional administrative costs (ongoing oversight, engagement, data management, and communications) and enforcement costs. Each operator would be assessed an annual base operator fee and an annual per device fee in order for the program to be cost-neutral to the public. See Attachment C for the proposed Fee Resolution. ', 'Permit', 'Fee', 'Annual Operator Fee', '$20,000 per operator', 'Annual Per Device Charge ', '$130 per device', ' ', 'The Council may consider an additional Use of Public Property charge as outlined in the program options above.

These Vendor Permits are subject to renewal on July 1, 2018.  Without this Ordinance, such Permits would be renewed for an entire 12 months.  However, these Permits were designed as a transition measure and their continuation would conflict with the proposed Pilot Program.  Accordingly, it is important to terminate these transition Permits and transition to the Pilot program in a timely and orderly manner.  Because July 1, 2018 is less than 30 days away from this Council meeting, it is necessary to adopt this Ordinance by Emergency to ensure that it is effective before July 1st.    ', ' ', 'Environmental Analysis ', 'The proposed ordinance is exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3). This section provides that CEQA only applies to those projects that have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment. The proposed ordinance does not have that possibility. The provision of shared mobility devices through private operators is anticipated to increase travel options with the result of reducing the use of automobiles for some shorter trips. Shared mobility devices available in the PROW may pose some nuisances, but this is not considered an environmental impact under CEQA. The proposed pilot program is temporary in nature, and provides additional guidance and enforcement tools to mitigate their presence in the City.

Instead of a pilot program, Council could direct staff to draft an ordinance that would establish a permanent regulatory structure permitting shared mobility devices, providing clarity on the scale, purpose, data-sharing and enforcement criteria for the program. Council could also direct staff to prohibit the operation of all shared device operations until a pilot or permanent regulatory structure is in effect, with the goal of removing all conflicting devices from the PROW.

In particular, the Board identified several notable aspects of the project including:', '·         The creation of an interconnected set of open spaces;', '·         The three-dimensional quality of the project;', '·         Livability of the residential units;', '·         The lightness of the implied color and materials;', '·         The separation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic;', '·         The relocation of the Landmark Victorian home appropriately creates an open court with the Spanish Colonial Revival Landmark building;', '·         Reconfiguration of the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Ocean Avenue with a new building; and', '·         The general massing of the project, in particular, the way the massing is broken into separate buildings and the additional massing placed along the street.', ' ', 'Board members made several recommendations for development of the project:', '·         In regard to the two designated Landmark buildings, there should be little or no elements added to the Ocean Avenue frontage, and that any additional elements or connections be reversible;', '·         Consideration of whether the museum building should be a quiet element in relation to the Landmark buildings or make a stronger architectural statement;', '·         The corner at Santa Monica Boulevard and Ocean Avenue should be stronger;', '·         The open spaces and First Court should remain open and activated;', '·         The landscape design for the project should have a strong identity, with sufficient soil depth included in the project and structural design;', '·         The residential buildings fronting the street should be more fully developed, perhaps with a stronger architectural identity;', '·         Consideration of an idea for signage throughout the site that is fully integrated;', '·         Pedestrian scale should be further developed throughout the design process;', '·         Consideration of the views at the terminus of the open spaces;', '·         Development of additional open space connections;', '·         Consideration of wind and solar orientation in the open spaces and around the project; and', '·         Consideration of location for bicycle lockers and storage at grade.', ' ', 'The Board also challenged the design team to consider the design of the central building to express an ascension skyward, and to design a project that will prove to be a landmark of the 21st Century.', ' ', 'Landmarks Commission – Preliminary Concept Discussion', 'The Landmarks Commission held its preliminary concept discussion on March 12, 2018. In summary, Commission members support the revised project design and note that the design needs to be further developed to provide greater specificity regarding the treatment of the Landmark buildings. Several Commission members also discussed whether the Landmark buildings should be integrated into the overall project with limited exterior interventions versus an imaginative treatment that responds more directly to the project’s contemporary architectural language. The following provides a summary of the feedback from individual Commissioners: ', ' ', '·         There is an opportunity to carefully and appropriately integrate the Landmark properties and treat them in a manner that would “breathe new life” into the buildings, with a priority on providing public access to the buildings.  ', '·         The museum campus should include appropriate, reversible, and imaginative treatment of the Landmark buildings so that their identity as historic buildings is retained.  The massing and configuration of the site is appropriate and an improvement from the previous iteration, and the massing and height variations of the proposal integrate nicely with the scale and massing of the Landmark buildings.', '·         The unique capabilities of the architect in handling the Landmarks are a welcome component of the project. There should be expressive design elements integrated into the treatment plan for the Landmark buildings.  There should also be special attention paid to glare and reflectivity as the design moves forward.', '·         The project’s open spaces will be a beneficial element of the project. Confidence was also expressed that the Applicant will integrate the well-documented framework for treatment of cultural resources, including the means and methods for appropriately moving and restoring historic buildings, into the project. ', '·         Maintaining the integrity of the Landmark structures and ensuring that their identity not be lost or consumed with this project should be a priority.   Concern was expressed regarding the timing of the demolition permit review process for the 101 Santa Monica Boulevard building due to the potential consequences of that process. It was also noted that because the project may require formal Landmarks Commission review in the future, comments provided at this point are necessarily preliminary in nature.', '·         The project should be implemented in a manner that maintains design harmony as envisioned in the project renderings. The two Landmark buildings should stand on their own and be rehabilitated.  Support was expressed for the open space and paseos and the tower element because it fits in well with the project. Researching the original plantings and design associated with the Landmark buildings would be informative and could be the basis for the future landscape design. Pedestrian and vehicular access were also noted as elements of importance for the project design. ', '·         The two Landmark buildings should be integrated into the museum campus as freestanding buildings, rather than connected to the museum.  The area around the Landmarks and museum should be a park-like space. While the massing of the museum appears appropriate, if the Landmark buildings are connected to the new structure, they may appear as an afterthought.  The onsite relocation of the two Landmarks should not be problematic though it is important that both buildings be placed at or near the elevation of the sidewalk.  The two Landmark buildings’ exteriors must be rehabilitated in accordance with the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. ', ' ', 'Based on the Commission’s concern regarding the anticipated timeline for submittal of the demolition permit application for the 101 Santa Monica Boulevard building, the Applicant agreed and formally submitted the application on March 23, 2018.  From that submittal date, the Landmarks Commission has 75 days to consider whether to file an application for designation of the building as a City Landmark or Structure of Merit. The property owner may extend that 75 day period to complete the demolition permit review.  ', ' ', 'The Commission discussed the demolition permit application at its April 9, 2018 meeting and requested preliminary information about the property. City staff requested an extension of time to finish its preliminary assessment of the property. With the property owner’s grant of an extension of time, it is anticipated that the Commission will complete its review of the demolition permit and determine whether to file a designation application at its July 9, 2018 meeting.  ', ' ', 'Planning Commission – Preliminary Concept Discussion', 'The Planning Commission held its preliminary concept discussion on May 2, 2018. After posing a series of questions to the Applicant team and a lengthy discussion, the Commission unanimously approved a motion (7-0) to recommend that the Council authorize staff to initiate negotiations for the Ocean Avenue Project, with consideration given to the Planning Commission’s comments. ', ' ', 'In summary, the Commission supports the project concept because it provides an important cultural facility as a community benefit; and offers a beautiful design that represents the Applicant team’s thoughtful study of the site and the relationship between building height and open space, and an emphasis on the pedestrian experience. The Commission expressed interest in seeing the architectural design concept developed further and underscored the need for project of the highest caliber that integrates the two Landmark buildings but also creates a stronger architectural identity for the museum campus. Commissioners also stated that additional study is required to ensure the project has an efficient and effective circulation plan for all modes that fits the Downtown’s complex mobility network. There was also preliminary discussion on how the project could more appropriately satisfy the DCP’s community benefit priority for affordable housing.  ', ' ', 'Community members’ comments provided at the Planning Commission are provided as Attachment “E”.  The following provides a summary of comments from individual Planning Commissioners, organized by theme:  ', ' ', 'Downtown Community Plan & Project Concept', '·         The DCP established a framework for Established Large Sites already; the project needs to conform. The City has the ability to reject the development agreement if it does not comply with City’s policy direction. ', '·         The overall project must be a place for people of all ages (programming, site planning, cultural campus, residential component, mix of uses, etc.). ', '·         The revised project concept and site plan is thoughtful and visually intriguing; positive changes include the updated open space plan, subterranean ballroom to reduce building mass above grade, and the overall design and integration of the replacement rent-controlled units into the project. ', ' ', 'Urban Design & Architectural Design Concept', '·         All Commissioners agreed that the updated concept proposes a beautiful and thoughtful project design at this beginning stage of the City review process. ', '·         The project site is unique along Ocean Avenue and at the end of Route 66. The site demands the best and the project must be a legacy to the City and stellar in all respects.', '·         The project cannot just create background buildings to the two Landmark structures. The design still needs to evolve and continue to develop on the ideas of fluidity and spontaneity.', '·         The project design is successful in accordance with the 130’ height limitation. ', '·         The corner of Ocean Avenue/Santa Monica feature must be exemplary and a welcoming area for all visitors to project – both in terms of design and programming.', '·         The applicant has presented a thoughtful design; the only issue is its maximum 130’ height. While 130’ might be useful for the proposed observation deck, that is perhaps not appropriate for other projects that were grouped together with the same maximum allowable height in the DCP. ', '·         Palisades Park and the bluffs are some of the best Landmark features in the city. The project changes the city skyline and diminishes the experience of the park and the visual character of the park and bluffs as viewed from the beach.', ' ', 'Site Planning & Open Space', '·         The updated open space plan provides an opportunity to make these spaces a true gathering place for the community and not just visitors.', '·         The pedestrian experience is vital to this project. Continue to develop the plan for pedestrians along Santa Monica Boulevard and Second Street. The overall site must feel like a space and project for the community instead of just a hotel. ', '·         It is beneficial that site planning and project design are still a “work in progress” and subject to more study.', '·         The east/west paseo between the hotel and restaurants needs more consideration. The use of the space seems wasteful and not fully conceived yet. ', '·         The courtyard south of the museum campus that leads to ballroom does not serve a purpose or create a place of interest.', ' ', 'Mobility/Circulation', '·         Mobility questions are important and require additional consideration and input from the City in terms of functionality and City policies/goals. How will vehicles get to/from the project? Think about flows for all modes and impacts to circulation in the surrounding area and specifically along Second Street. ', '·         The First Court paseo is a positive component of the project – it will increase pedestrian safety. ', '·         Breaking up the alley network with the closure and redirection of First Court may create the feeling of a superblock even with site porosity created by paseos. ', ' ', 'Museum Campus & Treatment of Historic Features', '·         The proposed museum building should not be a ‘background’ building; it is a critical project component and needs to have its own identity.', '·         The museum is a 60-foot tall building behind 30-foot tall Landmark structures; it will be quite visible whether it is designed to have a quiet or bold architectural presence. ', '·         While the museum campus concept will continue to be refined, the ideas/aspirations of the courtyard are not clear and defined enough yet.', '·         The design of the museum building should be simple and elegant but still special. ', '·         The museum courtyard could be a fun space for community members to explore and enjoy - and it could be heart of the project. Consider expanding this space further and consider connecting it to the observation deck entrance. ', ' ', 'Sustainability', '·         Sustainability will be a critically important project component. The Applicant has not addressed yet how the project will generate its own power and accommodate the practical necessity of developing a resilient building. ', ' ', 'Community Benefits', '·         The art museum/cultural institution is a much needed community benefit.', '·         The proposed affordable housing is a good balance for the hotel use, in terms of the project’s overall mix of uses and is consistent with the notion that the Downtown is also a residential community. ', '·         The DCP community benefit priorities are relevant – also see DCP Table 2A3 for a more detailed outline of community benefit categories. ', '·         The project should provide more affordable housing – although it is understandable why the replacement of rent-controlled units are separated from the overall unit count for the purposes of calculating the baseline percentage of affordable units. ', 'o       Replacement rent-controlled units should be included in the calculation of total units: aim for 30% of all units as affordable.', 'o       Consider the income targeting as set forth in the DCP but provide more lower-income category units.', '·         The project will need a robust Transportation Demand Management program with a program to incentivize non-Single Occupancy Vehicle trips to the museum and hotel.', '·         Refer to the local hiring framework that has been defined in recently-approved development agreements, including hiring disadvantaged individuals.', ' ', 'Project Site Information', 'The project site is approximately 82,500 SF in area and consists of eleven parcels located along Ocean Avenue at the northeast corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and across First Court with frontage along Santa Monica Boulevard and the west side of Second Street.

The structure was designated a City Landmark in August 2004 as an early and excellent example of a mixed-use building along Ocean Avenue building that reflects the period of development in the City when commercial development expanded to Ocean Avenue, a primarily residential street at the time. The building was also designated based on its architectural quality and its proximity to the two other early twentieth century Landmark structures on the block: the Victorian building and Gussie Moran House located at 1333 and 1323 Ocean Avenue.

Properties previously identified as potential contributors to the Central Business District were evaluated for individual eligibility using local, state, and federal criteria. ', ' ', 'As a result, the 101 Santa Monica Boulevard building was identified through survey evaluation as appearing eligible for listing as a Santa Monica Landmark (Status Code 5S3) as an example of “Spanish Colonial Revival architecture as applied to a commercial building with distinctive characteristics that are associated with the style as expressed by its form, massing, composition, and architectural details. It is also significant for representing early patterns of commercial development that shaped Santa Monica’s central business district prior to World War II.” ', ' ', 'Information about the two Landmark buildings and 101 Santa Monica Boulevard building’s HRI forms from 1980s-1990s surveys is available as Attachment “B”. 2017 Downtown Community Plan HRI information is provided as Attachment “C”.

These significant enhancements are identified as part of an overall strategy for potential economic and functional improvements to address anticipated future needs in the Downtown.', ' ', 'If the project were to be developed in compliance with the DCP’s Tier 2 standards, the maximum allowable height for the project would be between 50’-60’. However, the DCP established a codified, rigorous public process for projects on the three Established Large Sites to request consideration up to a height limit of 130 feet, subject to a Development Agreement; requirements for additional environmental review; and submittal of a detailed account of how the project meets the community benefit priorities set forth in the DCP. ', ' ', 'DCP policies and development standards identified for Established Large Sites specify a framework to ensure that projects proposed on the three identified sites are consistent with the community’s long-standing vision for an economically vital, culturally rich, and diverse Downtown anchored by complete neighborhoods, multi-modal circulation improvements, affordable housing, and a variety of cultural institutions, physical infrastructure, and public realm amenities. ', ' ', 'Specifically, Chapter 2A of the Downtown Community Plan (Attachment “F”) requires projects proposed on the three Established Large Sites to provide five priority community benefits, subject to negotiations regarding the specific level and type of benefit to be provided: ', '1.

This feedback was considered by the Applicant team in conjunction with the Council-adopted regulations and development standards set forth in the Downtown Community Plan for the Established Large Sites Overlay. ', ' ', 'The Applicant’s updated design concept provides several substantive revisions to the project that have been informed by initial community and staff input and the DCP’s urban design framework and site-specific development parameters. This section of the report provides a conceptual overview of several key changes that characterize the revised project design.  ', '·         Reduced Building Height – The revised project includes a podium and central tower design that is oriented in an east-west direction, with a maximum height of 130’ where 244’ was originally proposed. ', ' ', 'To achieve this height reduction, floor area and building mass are redistributed to other portions of the site with residential buildings ranging from approximately 60’ to 90’ along Santa Monica Boulevard, consistent with the existing development pattern along the boulevard heading east. ', ' ', 'Lower height buildings are maintained on the north side of the site, along Second Street (residential/commercial) and Ocean Avenue (museum complex). ', ' ', 'While not an analytical tool or development standard used in the DCP, the Applicant has provided an average building height analysis for the project to demonstrate how ground level open space and a variety of building scales affect the relationship between height, density, and design (see page 11 of project plans). The Applicant’s conceptual average building height analysis indicates that while a maximum height of 130’ in proposed, only 10% of the total site area would be constructed to that height – and the average building height for the site as a whole would be 43’-8”. ', ' ', '·         Revised Massing Strategy – As part of the continuing study of the site design in response to preliminary input from staff and ARB and the DCP’s standards, the overall massing strategy has been updated for the residential components (with ground floor retail) to reduce the perceived scale of the project-site block. ', ' ', 'o       In concert with the reduced height of the central tower and redistribution of floor area, the project now incorporates building mass along Santa Monica Boulevard and Second Street that has been broken down into four distinct residential buildings in order to: ', ' ', 'o       Better reflect the block pattern found in the Downtown;', 'o       Accommodate more substantial on-site pedestrian improvements;', 'o       Create a more integrated sequence of open spaces and common areas throughout the site. ', ' ', 'o       In conjunction with the building height adjustments noted above, the revised project includes significant upper-floor modulation to shape the redistributed building mass in order to: ', ' ', 'o       Improve the permeability of light and air throughout the site;', 'o       Create visual interest; and ', 'o       Create upper level hotel and residential common amenity areas that also moderate the overall scale of the buildings. ', ' ', '·         Pedestrian-Oriented Design and Mobility – The revised design concept incorporates buildings along Santa Monica Boulevard and Second Street that have been shaped and modulated at the ground level to further improve pedestrian travel through the site to a variety of programmed areas and to/from Ocean Avenue. ', ' ', 'o       The planned reuse and integration of First Court has been modified so that the first north/south section from Santa Monica Boulevard (approximately 130’ in length) is open and clear-to-the-sky and provides connection to an east/west paseo leading to Ocean Avenue. This revision was accomplished by removing a previously-proposed 2nd floor over the alley.', ' ', 'o       The organization of vehicular circulation and key pedestrian entrances to the hotel, residential buildings, and observation deck has been revised to create the following:', ' ', 'o       An uninterrupted pedestrian environment along Ocean Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard with consolidated vehicle ingress/egress points on Second Street and via First Court at Arizona Avenue; and', ' ', 'o       A stronger relationship between the public realm and the project’s proposed on-site pedestrian network and ground level open spaces.', ' ', '·         Revised Residential Program – As part of the reallocation of floor area and overall reduction of approximately 20,000 SF from the original submittal, the residential program was modified to eliminate the previously-proposed 22 condominium units so that the revised residential program is comprised entirely of 79 rental units in total.  ', ' ', '·         Conceptual Treatment of Designated Landmarks Buildings – The updated project design proposes retention and incorporation of the two designated Landmark buildings as part of the museum complex that will provide a strong historic and contemporary presence along Ocean Avenue.  The Victorian building is proposed for on-site relocation to the north edge of the site next to the extant Landmark Gussie Moran House and the Spanish Colonial Revival building would also be relocated/shifted to the north from its current location.  ', ' ', 'These on-site relocations would create an open courtyard with the new museum building in the middle and the Landmark Spanish Colonial Revival Building forming the south edge of museum campus. This plan would also reinforce the historic character of the 1300 Block of Ocean Avenue with the Landmark Shangri-La Hotel and Gussie Moran House also exemplifying the City’s historic development pattern on the Avenue. ', ' ', 'The overall design concept for the museum will continue to be developed and refined with a focus on how the two historic buildings will physically and visually be integrated with the new museum structure and how each of the buildings will retain an individual presence while also creating a harmonious and complementary cultural campus. ', ' ', 'Discussion', 'Development Agreement Process', 'Development Agreements are generally considered for complex projects with a significant scope and scale that current zoning standards may not address, and when the City has the opportunity to derive substantial community benefits from the project.  The City Council’s Development Agreement processing procedures require a preliminary concept/float-up discussion by the Architectural Review Board prior to Planning Commission and Council float-up discussions for certain types of projects in order to facilitate discussion about urban design and architectural design issues earlier during the application review process. ', ' ', 'Staff and the Applicant both agreed that, while not required, a preliminary discussion by the Landmarks Commission would also be beneficial as the project moves through the early review process. ', ' ', 'Comments from Council would help to shape and further refine the concept plan, and inform formulation and evaluation of community benefits, provided Council gives direction to staff to proceed with project negotiations. There will be no regulatory decisions made about the Development Agreement Application during the float-up process.', ' ', 'Preliminary Staff Review', 'Based on staff’s preliminary review of the new submittal, the revised design relates substantially better to the property’s unique site conditions in a distinctive and dense pedestrian environment across from Palisades Park and oriented west to the ocean. The proposed site design recognizes the urban patterns found in the Downtown District and complements this setting through building siting and orientation; building mass modulation applied - in particular - to the residential buildings; location of uses and program; and preservation and adaptive reuse of two designated City Landmark buildings.  In addition, of particular importance are the revisions that have been made to the project’s ground level open spaces and pedestrian circulation network. As shown in the Exhibit 1, the revised design incorporates open spaces and pedestrian paseos and paths that are more visually accessible from the street, user-friendly, and connected to the streetscape, in comparison to the Applicant’s 2013 submittal.

FY 2018-19 is also the first year of the FY 2018-20 Proposed Biennial Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Budget, which follows the same principles of fiscally sustainable and outcome-driven resource allocation of the operating budget as it makes significant investments in maintaining and enhancing critical City infrastructure and City facilities essential to providing services. Santa Monica is a leader in responsible financial and environmental leadership in municipal capital planning and construction. Funding for critical infrastructure protects the City’s existing capital investment and minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs.', ' ', 'The total FY 2018-19 Citywide Proposed Budget is $732.5 million, $439.1 million of which is in the General Fund. The FY 2018-19 Proposed Budget represents a 5% decrease over the FY 2018‐19 Budget Plan, due mostly to changes in capital project timing. While there is a small increase in permanent staff in the General Fund to address public safety, reductions in staff in other funds result in a decrease of 0.8 Full‐Time Equivalent (FTE) positions overall. The total Proposed Capital Improvement Program Budget is $186.3 million in FY 2018-19, and $115.4 million FY 2019-20. Budget and FTE changes to the FY 2018-19 Budget Plan are summarized in the following table:', ' ', ' ', 'The May 2018 General Fund Financial Status Update includes the Proposed FY 2018‐19 Budget in its projection of the City’s future budget climate. The Update shows positive balances during the first three years of the five-year forecast and shortfalls of $7.1 million and $15.2 million (3.6% of the General Fund Budget), respectively, in the last two years. The projected shortfalls are due primarily to anticipated increases in pension costs in spite of the City’s significant prepayments to the retirement system.  ', ' ', 'The financial status of other funds remains relatively stable. As previously reported, the Housing Authority Fund is projected to require subsidies through the end of the forecast period. The Cemetery Fund is projecting a deficit in two years, and staff are assessing operations to provide a long term plan for the fund. The Pier Fund is also projected to require subsidies as the combination of operating and large capital expenditures are outpacing the growth of revenues during the forecast period.', ' ', 'Also presented in this report are proposed new fees and revisions to certain Community and Cultural Services fees, zoning fees and residential preferential parking fees. ', ' ', 'Background', 'On June 27, 2017 (Attachment A), Council adopted the first year and approved the second year of the FY 2017-19 Biennial Budget; and adopted the second year of the FY 2016-18 Capital Improvement Program Budget. On October 24, 2017 (Attachment B) and February 13, 2018 (Attachment C), Council approved certain revisions to the FY 2017-18 Adopted Budget that adjusted revenues and expenditures, and approved corresponding adjustments to the FY 2018-19 Budget Plan. The February 2018 Update showed three years of positive General Fund structural balances before an anticipated shortfall in FY 2020-21 and in FY 2021-22. Since February, staff completed an exception-based budget process, identifying budget adjustments to reallocate resources to higher priority areas, and to reflect revenue changes that occurred since the biennial budget adoption.  ', ' ', 'Discussion', 'Economic Update', 'The current economic expansion is now one of the longest in the post-World War II era, and economic growth both on a national and State level is expected to continue in the near term.  However, there are signs that the growth is leveling off, and history would indicate that the economy is likely to head into a recession sometime within the next five years.', ' ', 'While the State budget has also expanded in recent years to attempt to correct long term issues, and the Governor’s FY 2018-19 Budget predicts a healthy surplus, a recession could reduce State revenues by an estimated $20 billion annually over several years. Also, although the effect of Federal tax law changes cannot yet be measured, given the disproportionate dependence of State revenues on the wealthiest individuals, the net impact could increase the volatility in State income tax receipts.', ' ', 'Santa Monica’s economy remains relatively strong. However, there are signs of moderation in the local economy’s growth rate. General Fund revenue growth is slowing down after several years of strong increases. Average annual growth over the last three years has been less than 4% following growth rates of over 8% in the three years of recovery following the recession.', ' ', 'Within this context, the City’s General Fund forecast continues to show modest revenue growth as the City absorbs the impacts of a changing economic landscape, present in the on-going shift to on-line sales from brick and mortar and alternative transportation models. Also, as with the State and national economies, the threat of a recession could significantly alter revenue projections. More information on some of the City’s key revenue sources is provided below.', ' ', 'Property values in the City remain the third highest in Los Angeles County for a City with the 19th largest population. For the third consecutive year the FY 2017-18 assessed value increase was within the range of 6%. Moderate increases of 3-4% are projected over the next five years.', ' ', 'Sales tax (both sales and use and transaction and use tax) growth is expected to be modest, reflecting the global shift of retail activity from brick and mortar businesses to on-line businesses, a softening in auto sales, and some corrections by taxing entities.  City taxable sales are projected to be relatively flat in FY 2018-19, with future annual growth rates in the 2‐2.5% range.', ' ', 'Tourism, which provides a major stimulus to the local economy by creating jobs and producing revenues, continues to show strength. Transient Occupancy Taxes have increased at an average annual rate of over 9% over the last seven years. While the overall growth rate is expected to moderate over the next few years, the recent addition of two hotels with 260 new rooms to the lodging supply as well as another hotel with 271 rooms in the construction phase will continue to bolster City revenues. One area of uncertainty over the forecast period is the impact that new registration requirements for home share hosting platforms will have on current revenue projections.', ' ', 'Business License Taxes are expected to be relatively flat in FY 2018-19 and then show baseline growth of approximately 2% annually over the forecast period. Utility Users Tax revenues are expected to remain relatively flat over the forecast period as revenues from telecommunication services continue to drop. Parking Facility Taxes are expected to grow by approximately 4% in FY 2018-19 reflecting revised downtown parking rates, then grow by less than 2% over the remainder of the forecast period. Interest rates have risen sharply in the last year after the historically low levels of the prior seven years, resulting in greater investment income. While a gradual increase is expected over the forecast period, rates are still expected to remain at relatively low levels.', ' ', 'Staff will continue to monitor parking revenues, a consistently strong revenue source for the City. Parking revenues from downtown parking structures and lots are expected to end FY 2017-18 approximately 7% below prior year levels, reflecting a significant shift in how people travel into and around the City. This is primarily a result of EXPO light rail and ridesharing services providing alternative modes of transportation for visitors and community members. However, recent Council-approved rate revisions should restore parking revenues to previous levels.', ' ', 'The forecast also reflects annual cost of living adjustments for user fees and charges as well as recently completed cost of services studies for the Planning and Community Development and Community and Cultural Services departments. Additionally, the forecast reflects new fee revenues from implementation of the City’s seismic retrofit program. Building and Safety permit revenue projections are expected to peak in FY 2017-18 and FY 2018-19 reflecting the number of mixed use housing projects that have been approved in the past few years and the adoption of the Downtown Community Plan, which has made it easier for uses such as restaurants and fitness facilities to open in the Downtown area.', ' ', 'At the time of the adoption of the FY 2017-19 Operating Budget, the transmittal letter warned about financial challenges in the future: “This budget responds to the known challenges projected in our five-year forecast. The pressures from rising costs for pensions, workers’ compensation, and healthcare are not new. Each, however, has been exacerbated due to recent developments. Additionally, we are seeing significant increases in construction and maintenance costs due to economic conditions and new statutes. Disturbingly, federal funding may be negatively impacted by policies coming out of the White House. Finally, if the current economic expansion continues during the upcoming two-year budget cycle, it will be the longest period of growth in the past 100 years -- and cannot go on indefinitely.  These threats impact the General Fund as well as the City’s other funds.”  All these long-term concerns remain as we proceed with the second year of a budget that is balanced and look forward to significant adjustments that will need to be made in the FY 2019-21 budget cycle.', ' ', 'Looming over the City’s strong financial health is the currently projected $461 million unfunded pension liability.  This long-term obligation reflects the impact of overly optimistic assumptions by CalPERS in prior years, and member agencies’ (including the City of Santa Monica’s) decisions to increase benefits based on these assumptions, as well as the drastic reduction in CalPERS’ investment portfolio during the Great Recession.  While Santa Monica is not alone, Santa Monica’s commitment to long-term fiscal responsibility and sustainability impels serious action to reduce this shortfall.  That’s why Santa Monica was a leader in establishing lower pension benefits for everyone hired after July 1, 2012 and last year the City made an advance additional payment to CalPERS of $45 million, bringing the total of our voluntary advance payments to $76 million.  The magnitude of the remaining shortfall, however, will require additional tangible and likely painful diversion of funding to address this threat to our fiscal health.  The year ahead will provide the opportunity for dialogue with our community and our workforce about how together we address this need and set the basis for Council to establish specific and measurable policy goals to ensure our pension obligations are adequately funded.', ' ', 'General Fund Financial Status Update', 'The General Fund Financial Status Update reflects the revised revenue projections and proposed operating budget changes included in this staff report. Staff has completed three forecast scenarios that consider Best, Probable, and Worst Case impacts on the General Fund. The chart below shows the three forecast scenarios.', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'The Probable scenario serves as the baseline for the forecast and assumes that operations will remain at their current level and structure. In this scenario, the General Fund is projected to experience a shortfall of approximately $7.1 million in FY 2020‐21 that increases to $15.2 million (3.6% of the General Fund budget) in FY 2021‐22. Health insurance and workers’ compensation costs continue to be cost drivers, although the largest challenge is the significant rise in the cost of pensions. Based on the most recent actuarial analysis, net pension contributions in the General Fund are anticipated to increase 37% ($14.9 million) by FY 2021-22, and will continue to increase at a high rate through FY 2023-24, when the phasing in of the most recent decrease to the discount rate assumption, used to determine the future value of the pension portfolio, will be complete. Over the next several months, staff will study the feasibility of various methods to lower pension contributions and healthcare costs and will ask Council to consider alternatives as part of the next biennial budget process. Overall, operating expenditures are anticipated to grow an average of 3.8% per year during this period, while ongoing revenues are anticipated to grow an average of 2.4% per year.', ' ', 'In the Best Case scenario, bolstered by higher increases in revenues, General Fund revenues would continue to exceed expenditures until FY 2021-22, when a $5.7 million shortfall is projected. The Worst Case scenario shows the effects of a possible recession as well as intensification of some potentially negative trends in the areas of parking, sales, transient occupancy and business license tax. In this scenario, the General Fund would experience a shortfall of $3.5 million in FY 2019-20 that would increase significantly to $30.6 million in FY 2021-22.', ' ', 'Other Funds Status', 'Other major funds included in the Financial Status Update fall into two categories: 1) funds that operate with sufficient revenues to sustain necessary operating and capital needs; and 2) funds that have a structural deficit where ongoing revenues are not sufficient to cover ongoing expenditures.', ' ', 'Self-Sustaining Enterprise Funds', 'The Water and Wastewater Funds have sufficient revenues to cover current operations. Based on existing analysis, rate increases in the Water Fund allow the implementation of the Sustainable Water Master Plan while also maintaining reserve levels. As noted at the recent public hearing to adopt the current rates, additional studies are underway to further assess the financial needs to achieve Water Self-Sufficiency and those reports are scheduled to be presented to the Council in August 2018. The Wastewater Fund continues to have adequate revenues and reserves to meet current operational and capital expenditures.', ' ', 'The Resource Recovery and Recycling (RRR) Fund will maintain a positive fund balance over the next five years. There are several upcoming proposals that may have a substantial impact on the financial stability of the fund, including various solid waste and recycling initiatives and pilot programs, the Fund’s share of costs to complete the Corporate Yards modernization project, and the displacement of the recycling contractor at the Corporate Yards that will result in additional costs for transporting the City-collected recycling materials to an offsite location. Staff will continue to monitor fund performance and consider the need for a rate increase in the future.', ' ', 'The Big Blue Bus (BBB) Fund balance reflects the department’s need to tap into reserves in the first three years of the forecast and the potential utilization of Municipal Operator Service Improvement Program (MOSIP) funds in the last two years. While MOSIP funding can be used for both operating and capital expenditures, BBB expenses its share of the funding to support the capital program that includes bus procurement, fleet and operational technology projects, bus stop improvements and infrastructure projects. It is anticipated that the Department will rely more heavily on MOSIP funds as future bus procurement costs will increase as the Department embarks on the procurement of electric buses and related yard and facility infrastructure improvements needed to support electric buses. BBB has never used MOSIP funding to balance the budget. The department historically ends each fiscal year within budget due to savings in materials, supplies, and fuel.', ' ', 'BBB’s passenger revenue has finally shown signs of leveling in FY 2017-18 YTD after three consecutive years of decline. Revenue from the recently-approved Los Angeles County Measure M sales tax increase along with the implementation of planned operational strategies will assist the department in reducing the impact of increased costs associated with workers’ compensation, general liability, and other escalating costs, which will narrow the gap between operating revenues and expenses.  ', ' ', 'In September of 2018, BBB will make minor modifications to routes that will realize some expenditure savings. Staff will evaluate rededicating these savings to ridership growth areas in order to boost ridership and passenger revenue during the last quarter of FY 2018-19. A more aggressive set of changes geared to new service planning standards will be introduced in 2019 pending rider and staff engagement as well as feedback, public hearings and Council approval.  Those changes are expected to more dramatically reduce operating costs and support ridership growth, further narrowing the gap between revenues and expenditures. BBB will continue to monitor its performance and staff will return to Council in FY 2018-19 to present the new planning service standards, proposed service changes and procurement/operation of the new electric bus fleet.', ' ', 'The Airport, Beach, and Community Broadband Funds will generate adequate revenues to sustain their operations throughout the next five years.', ' ', 'Funds Requiring Subsidies', 'The Housing Authority Fund has a projected operating structural deficit of approximately $0.7 million to $1 million annually throughout the forecast period. This assumes that U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding to housing authorities will not be reduced. For FY 2018-19, the Housing Authority will require an operating subsidy from affordable housing funds set aside in the Special Revenue Source Fund.', ' ', 'The Cemetery Fund is projecting a deficit of approximately $50,000 in FY 2019-20 that increases to approximately $0.3 million in FY 2021-22. The implementation of the green burial program has not realized the anticipated growth in the fund. The fund required a General Fund loan at the end of FY 2016-17 and is projected to require additional General Fund loans starting in FY 2019-20 if no changes are made to the operations of the Cemetery. Staff is assessing operations to provide a long term self-sustainable plan for the Cemetery Fund.', ' ', 'The Pier Fund is not able to sustain an adequate balance to cover both its operating costs and large capital expenditures. Capital needs that cannot be funded by the Pier Fund during the forecast period must compete with General Fund-supported capital needs. It has been Council practice to subsidize the Pier as a public space, rather than create a loan receivable to the General Fund. The Pier Fund has a projected operating structural deficit of $0.5 million in FY 2021-22 due to anticipated decreases in lease revenues due to construction impacts of various planned capital projects.', ' ', 'Expenditure Control Budgeting Policy', 'Based on the City’s fiscal policy, one-third of each year’s General Fund non-salary operating budget savings may be reappropriated to the departments that achieve the savings. The remaining two-thirds of the non-salary savings is incorporated into the General Fund fund balance. In the spirit of the two-year planning and budgeting cycle, staff recommends that departments carry over FY 2017-18 non-salary savings to FY 2018-19 in order to complete projects that may have been delayed in the first year of the biennial budget. Therefore, staff recommends changing the City’s Fiscal Policy to eliminate expenditure control budgeting for year 1 of the biennial budget cycle.', ' ', 'Process/Activity Efficiency Proposals', 'As the City faces new fiscal challenges in the future, staff is revamping its upcoming biennial budget process to one based on performance measurement and allocating resources where they are best used.  In the interim, as part of the Exception-Based Budget process, departments were asked to begin thinking in this way and provide at least one change in their operations for FY 2018-19 that either streamlines or eliminates a process or activity. Many departments were able to take advantage of existing and upcoming technology to support their changes. The proposals may not directly result in a budget savings, but rather make more efficient use of resources. A sample list of process/activity efficiency proposals is detailed in Attachment D. Staff will provide a roadmap for the transition to a performance based budget as part of the budget adoption staff report.', ' ', 'Exception-Based FY 2018-19 Operating Budget Adjustments', 'The Citywide operating FY 2018-19 Proposed Budget is $546.3 million, $372.5 million of which is in the General Fund.

The most significant increases include $0.2 million annually to maintain the Civic Center Multipurpose Sports Field starting in FY 2020-21, and up to $0.2 million annually at the end of the five-year planning to maintain and pay for electricity for electric vehicle charging stations as more are installed. Staff will return to Council for consideration of a cost-recovery recommendation after at least 25 “smart” Electric Vehicle charging stations have been operational for three months or more; it is anticipated that this will be in spring 2019. These types of ongoing costs are considered by the CIP Committee when projects are evaluated during the CIP Budget Process to ensure that the Capital Budget Plan does not create unsustainable ongoing maintenance needs. The costs are also included in the five-year financial forecast in all scenarios.', ' ', 'Operations and maintenance costs associated with capital projects approved in prior biennial CIP budgets are updated regularly and continually inform updated five-year forecasts and operating budget proposals. Operating budget increases in non-General Funds are able to be supported by those funds. ', ' ', 'CIP Budget Process', 'The CIP budget process is facilitated by a CIP Committee comprised of the City’s Department Heads, the City Manager, and the Assistant City Manager. Departments prepare project application submittals for funding consideration, and the CIP Committee reviews and scores applications against the criteria outlined below. Project budget requests, particularly for General Fund capital dollars, have exceeded available funding in recent years. Project applications are evaluated within the context of available funding limits to ensure that limited resources fund one-time priority projects while also effectively maintaining the City’s existing infrastructure.  ', ' ', 'The CIP Committee scores projects that are competing for limited funds according to three broad criteria, defined as follows: ', ' ', 'Mandated Activities', '·         Projects necessary for health and safety reasons that cannot be deferred', '·         Projects mandated by the Federal or State government', '·         Projects necessary to adequately maintain existing facilities, infrastructure, or equipment', '·         Projects underway that have unavoidable budget shortfalls and that cannot be modified', 'Council / Community Priorities', '·         Projects that clearly address a Framework Outcome and/or meet a Council Strategic Goal  ', '·         Projects that respond to a Council action or directive ', '·         Projects identified in an adopted City planning document', 'Fiscal Responsibility ', '·         Projects that will improve operational efficiencies and achieve ongoing cost savings', '·         Projects that generate revenue', '·         Projects where significant outside funding has been obtained to leverage City funding', ' ', 'Based on evaluation against these criteria, capital budget recommendations are presented to the City Council for consideration.  ', ' ', 'The Capital Improvement Program and the Framework', 'The City of Santa Monica is connecting its budget to the Framework, connecting key departmental goals and activities to seven outcome areas, drawn from the Sustainable City Plan and the Wellbeing Index. The Framework is the City of Santa Monica’s strategic direction, connecting organizational purpose and day-to-day functions for a sustainable city of wellbeing built on a foundation of good governance. ', ' ', 'The FY 2018-20 CIP Biennial Budget advances five of the seven Framework Outcome Areas. Primarily, the capital program addresses Place & Planet, helping create a resilient built and natural environment. Roughly seventy percent of capital dollars are allocated to projects that advance the Place & Planet Outcome Area during the biennial budget period. These projects primarily address the sub-outcome area of Infrastructure, to develop, protect, and maintain City-owned infrastructure. ', ' ', 'The CIP also addresses the Governance outcome area by funding capital projects that promote a reliable, effective, and efficient government. These projects primarily address the sub-outcome area of Effective and Efficient Business Processes through software and hardware enhancements and City vehicle procurement.', ' ', 'In addition, the Biennial CIP Budget addresses the Safety outcome area through projects such as the procurement of new fire vehicles, safety improvements for pedestrians and cyclists, and the installation of fire sprinklers and bollards on the Pier.', ' ', 'In the Health Outcome Area, the largest project is the Civic Center Multipurpose Sports field, which addresses the Physical Health sub-outcome area. In the Community Outcome Area, there is one proposed project to upgrade the audio-visual system in the City Council Chambers will help facilitate community engagement.', ' ', '  ', '* This includes one project with a budget of $200,500, or 0.07% of the Biennial Budget.', ' ', 'The Capital Improvement Program and Council’s Strategic Goals', 'The FY 2018-20 CIP Biennial Budget and the five-year Capital Plan also continue to advance Council’s adopted Strategic Goals. In particular, creating a new model for mobility is an ongoing focus of the CIP and is central to the proposed five-year Plan. The Plan includes over 20 mobility-related projects, both new and ongoing, with total recommended budget allocations of roughly $32 million over the biennial period (excluding Big Blue Bus spending). ', ' ', 'The FY 2018-20 Proposed CIP Budget adds additional funding to some of the existing projects and also funds several new mobility projects. Mobility projects included in the CIP meet one or more of the following criteria: they are identified in adopted plans to complete bike, pedestrian and transit networks; they advance work toward Vision Zero; they leverage outside transportation funds; and they are coordinated with adjacent projects or maintenance efforts. Some key mobility projects in the FY 2018-20 Proposed Budget include: the 17th Street Expo Bike Connectivity Improvement Project which will add a protected bikeway along 17th Street from Wilshire Blvd. to Pico Blvd. and continue Greenway treatment along Michigan Ave from 14th Street to 19th Court ($9.2 million total project budget); Phase 1 of the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan which will enhance pedestrian safety along Lincoln Blvd. ($5.0 million total project budget); Pedestrian Improvements at Four Schools ($1.8 million) and at Six (additional) Schools ($1.9 million); Vision Zero and Mobility Project Delivery ($1.6 million); Design of an Ocean Avenue Protected Bikeway from California to Colorado ($0.6 million); Pico Blvd. and Santa Monica College Pedestrian Safety Improvements ($1.2 million); and several additional smaller projects and studies.  ', ' ', 'The FY 2018-20 CIP budget will advance accessibility work at the Pier to contribute to an Inclusive and Diverse Community, and will make park improvements related to the City’s work to address homelessness. In addition, the Proposed Budget includes a Library Facilities Master Plan project that will address the Learn and Thrive strategic goal, and the Airport Runway Repurposing to address Council’s Airport strategic goal.  ', ' ', 'Other Major Areas of Focus  ', 'In addition to completing critical ongoing infrastructure maintenance activities, this five-year capital plan advances work in several key focus areas related to parks and beach improvements, water and stormwater projects, and the modernization of critical City facilities. ', ' ', 'Park and Beach Improvements ', 'The City Council directed ambitious park expansion and beach improvements in Santa Monica that are currently underway along with processes to update the Parks and Recreation Master Plan (originally adopted in 1997) and complete a Master Plan for the renovation and expansion of Memorial Park. The previous Biennial Budget funded completion of the Airport Park Expansion design phase and this budget funds design for Memorial Park Expansion based on Master Plan outcomes. Future construction of the Memorial Park project will be partially supported by a $20 million allocation of Santa Monica College Measure V funds. Financing options for the full Memorial Park construction budget will be further analyzed as cost estimates and funding opportunities evolve. Alternative financing could come from a variety of sources including parks and recreation development impact fees, Los Angeles County Measure A allocations and grant opportunities, and proceeds from a potential future local general obligation bond. ', ' ', 'This Proposed Biennial CIP Budget also funds construction of improvements to the North Beach Trail and completion of the Civic Center Multipurpose Sports Field, with reserve funding previously set aside for the field appropriated to the budget in FY 2018-19. ', ' ', 'Water & Stormwater Projects', 'The FY 2018-20 Biennial CIP Budget advances the City’s efforts to achieve Council’s goal of becoming water self-sufficient. Several current and planned projects are designed to capture and treat stormwater and wastewater for reuse, improve the efficiency of our water treatment systems, and continue to reduce reliance on imported water by developing new local sources. Staff will return to Council in August 2018 with an updated Sustainable Water Master Plan (SWMP) which includes projects that are already underway, such as the Clean Beaches Initiative, a 1.6-million-gallon cistern currently being installed adjacent to the Pier, and planned projects such as the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP) which will capture and treat stormwater and wastewater for beneficial reuse locally. The total budget for SWIP is $69.8 million, $56.9 of which is a state loan from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. ', ' ', 'In addition, the SWMP calls for installation of new local groundwater wells, and efficiency improvements of the City’s current water treatment and metering systems designed to provide extra water and minimize leaks and water waste in the system. The FY 2018-20 Proposed CIP Budget funds several projects that will advance these goals, including a City/USGS Monitoring Well and Numerical Flow Model, the Redrilling of Santa Monica Well #3, and Arcadia Reverse Osmosis Recovery to improve treatment plant efficiency. The Water Fund is able to support all ongoing, routine capital work. Significant one-time capital expenditures are required to advance Council’s goal of water self-sufficiency. The Proposed CIP Budget includes a transfer of $2.3 million in Gillette/Boeing Settlement Funds to support two of the water self-sufficiency projects, the City/USGS Monitoring Well and Numerical Flow Model, and Redrilling Santa Monica Well # 3. A new water rate study to be completed in 2019 will identify additional work and funding necessary to meet the water self-sufficiency goal. ', ' ', 'Modernization of Critical City Facilities', 'During the FY 2018-20 biennial period, work will continue on two critical City facilities that were funded in the FY 2016-18 CIP budget—the City Services Building and Fire Station 1. Construction is underway on the City Services Building and is anticipated to be complete in 2020.  The 50,200-square-foot Living Building Challenge building will create a centralized Permit Center and an efficient, sustainable City Hall campus.  Construction of the new Fire Station 1 will begin this summer and is also anticipated to be complete in 2020. The 28,690-square-foot station will be located at 1337-1345 7th Street and will replace the existing Fire Station 1. ', ' ', 'Work will also continue on the City Yards Modernization project, which received design funding in the FY 2016-18 CIP Budget. The City Yards is a 14.7-acre site located at 2500 Michigan Avenue that serves as the base for the City’s maintenance operations, associated offices, storage facilities, and other industrial uses. Since the City acquired the site in the 1940s, its operations have been adapted on an as-needed basis for various City functions, resulting in an inefficient utilization of space that no longer meets the functional needs of the facility. Schematic design is now complete, and the estimated cost to complete a modified scope of the first phase of the project is $114 million. ', ' ', 'The FY 2018-20 CIP plan proposes utilizing $38.3 million in Charnock settlement funds to fund a portion of construction. The source of funds for the remaining $64.0 million required for construction will need to be identified during this biennial period.  It is anticipated that these funds will come from contributions from enterprise funds, as well as possibly bond financing, settlement funds, or other sources. In any funding scenario, costs would be allocated to other funds with associated operations at the City Yards, including Resource, Recovery, and Recycling and the Vehicle Management Fund. City Yards Modernization efforts would also be coordinated with adjacent Water and Wastewater plans, ensuring that those funds would also contribute their share of costs. Staff will explore financing options and return to Council with a recommendation. ', ' ', 'Unfunded Projects', 'Projects that do not receive funding are listed in the budget document and are tracked for consideration in future funding cycles. In some cases, these are still high priority projects but they may need to be deferred for a number of reasons such as exploring opportunities to leverage City funds with external funding, or to acknowledge workload considerations where existing staffing capacity is fully committed to other urgent projects. In some cases, staff is able to continue preliminary or related work until it is possible to fully fund a broader effort. ', ' ', 'Airport Park Expansion is the largest project on the unfunded list at this time. Design of the park is now complete, and staff continues to explore funding options for construction. Alternative financing could come from a variety of sources including parks and recreation development impact fees, Los Angeles County Measure A allocations and grant opportunities, and proceeds from a potential future local general obligation bond. Staff will continue to explore alternate financing options and provide recommendations to Council as opportunities arise.', ' ', 'Phase 2 of the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan, which consists primarily of pedestrian lighting, is also on the unfunded list. However, phase 1 of the project, which includes median and crosswalk improvements, is funded in the Proposed Budget.', ' ', 'Council Discretionary Funds', 'Each year, Council allocates discretionary funds to assist the community in special projects or support important but otherwise unfunded priorities.', ' ', 'Council has traditionally supported community partners like the Business Improvement Districts, Santa Monica traditions like the Fourth of July Parade, one-time programs, and community students through science or music grants allowing Santa Monica youth to participate in special events. Projects and programs supported by Council discretionary funds for the past three years are detailed in Attachment K.', ' ', 'Allocation of the funds may occur along with Budget Adoption or throughout the year. Including unallocated FY 2017-18 discretionary funds and FY 2018-19 discretionary funds, the Council has access to $756,243 in FY 2018-19.', ' ', 'Financial Impacts and Budget Actions', 'The FY 2018-19 Proposed Budget is $732.5 million. This amount represents a 7% decrease over the FY 2017-18 Revised Budget and a 5% decrease over the FY 2018‐19 Budget Plan, due mostly to decreased capital spending. Staff will return to Council on June 12, 2018 to recommend adoption of the FY 2018-19 Proposed Budget.']}, {'Title': ' Second Reading and Adoption of Ordinance Amending Santa Monica Municipal Code Section 10.08.560 to Update Vehicle Weight Restriction Requirements for the Santa Monica Municipal Pier and the Newcomb Pier', 'ID': '3077', 'MeetingID': '1141', 'Department': "City Attorney's Office - Second Reading", 'Sponsors': None, 'Actions': [], 'Body': ['At its meeting on May 8, 2018, the City Council introduced for first reading an ordinance amending the Santa Monica Municipal Code Section 10.08.560, to update vehicle weight restriction requirements for the Santa Monica Municipal Pier and the Newcomb Pier.

The City Council already approved a number of minor policy changes, corrections, and clarifications earlier in 2017. The proposed changes identified in this report are intended to provide clarification of standards, improve and update regulations, and eliminate any potential confusion in the application of standards without significantly altering the intent of standards and regulations within the Zoning Ordinance.  Further, there are three areas where amendments are proposed to provide more clarity and flexibility with respect to key issues that have arisen in implementation of the zoning ordinance including the appropriate maximum size of accessory dwelling units, space-efficient parking, and street wall height.  This report provides a summary of the key changes being proposed in these policy areas in addition to providing more background on the Planning Commission’s recommendation regarding an amendment to support code enforcement efforts.', ' ', 'Background', 'On June 23, 2015, the City Council adopted a new Zoning Ordinance that became effective on July 24, 2015. Since the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance and through its implementation to date, staff has identified unintentional errors, inconsistencies, or omissions that require minor clerical changes, corrections, or clarifications as well as policy issues that require further discussion and analysis.  ', ' ', 'On May 24, 2016, June 28, 2016 and February 14, 2017, following Planning Commission review and recommendations, the City Council adopted Ordinances making the minor clerical changes, corrections, and clarifications. ', ' ', 'On August 2, 2017, the Planning Commission preliminarily discussed the second category of Zoning Ordinance policy issues that have arisen since adoption and implementation of the Zoning Ordinance. This took place in advance of formal consideration of these policy issues and in advance of making a formal recommendation to the City Council. After this preliminary discussion, the Commission split these policy issues into two groups, of which the Council approved the first group of policy item changes at its December 5, 2017 meeting.', ' ', 'Discussion', 'On April 18, 2018, after review and discussion of the proposed amendments for the second group of Zoning Ordinance policy item changes, the Planning Commission voted 5-0 (2 absent) to adopt a Resolution recommending that the City Council approve these proposed changes, corrections, and clarifications to the Zoning Ordinance. The Planning Commission reviewed and endorsed the proposed redline changes as drafted without any modifications. However, the Commission expressed their desire to highlight two proposed amendments regarding Accessory Dwelling Units and code enforcement, which are further discussed below.', ' ', 'The proposed changes identified in this report are intended to provide clarification of standards, improve and update regulations, and eliminate any potential confusion in the application of standards. The changes do not significantly alter the standards and regulations within the Zoning Ordinance. The specific changes, corrections, and clarifications are detailed in the attached Proposed Redline Modifications (Attachment A) along with brief explanations for each change, correction, and clarification (Attachment B). ', ' ', 'For each of the topics, this report summarizes in Attachment B the policy topic, purpose of each standard, how the issue was brought to staff’s attention, and what the clarifying language will do.', ' ', 'Street Wall Height', 'The concept of requiring minimum and maximum first-story street wall heights in certain districts was to provide pedestrian-oriented ground floor design, allow for variety of commercial uses on ground floor, and provide a consistent design pattern along commercial streets. The first-story street wall height standard is currently required in the Commercial and Mixed-Use districts, the Employment districts, and the Oceanfront district. Architects and developers have found the standard to be challenging to meet for parcels with unique sloping conditions and for prospective smaller buildings with limited stories. The Architectural Review Board has also commented that the first-story street wall height standard creates challenges for a pedestrian-scaled ground floor and odd proportions compared with a building’s upper floors.', ' ', 'In order to address this challenge and provide consistency with the standards in the recently adopted Downtown Community Plan, staff proposes eliminating the first story street wall height requirements and utilizing minimum ground floor floor-to-floor heights instead. In addition, creating a standard defining the maximum allowable separation between the ground floor level and the adjacent finished grade facing a commercial boulevard with no relation to technical definition of building stories seeks to maintain a relevant ground floor pedestrian orientation and active commercial design along the commercial boulevards. This standard would vary slightly between non-sloping ground-floor street frontages along commercial boulevards and sloped ground-floor street frontages along commercial boulevards in order to provide a little more flexibility for sloped sites. Allowing for the ability to apply for a Major Modification from the minimum and maximum ground floor floor-to-floor heights provides additional flexibility from these standards. The Planning Commission as well as members of the public supported these changes.', ' ', 'Space-Efficient Parking', 'Given the advancements in both the technology and reliability of mechanical parking systems, staff believes it is appropriate to explore providing flexibility for use of these systems. As a result, the proposed Code amendments to Section 9.28.090 are intended to regulate three broad types of space-efficient parking: tandem parking, mechanical tandem parking such as stackers, and fully automated systems that are independently accessible (i.e. do not require moving a vehicle by human power for access).', ' ', 'A requirement for a parking attendant was included for all space-efficient parking with the exception of residential projects with two or fewer units, or when tandem spaces are assigned to the same dwelling unit. Parking Attendants are also not required when it is demonstrated that mechanical parking systems can be operated by the end user or when the tandem parking does not exceed 25 percent of total parking for nonresidential uses.  ', ' ', 'A Parking and Loading Operation Plan is required with limited exception, and is intended to ensure the parking is managed in a way that allows adequate access to vehicles and to minimize the impacts to the public right-of-way.  ', ' ', 'A queuing space requirement was added to ensure that staging space is provided for vehicles to wait on private property prior to parking entry. Both the queuing space and attendant requirements may be reduced when technical study supports the reduction. Technical study is also required when Automated Parking Systems serve high-turnover land uses to ensure the provision of some short term parking to allow quick access and retrieval of vehicles. Nonoperation provisions were added to ensure that vehicles may enter or be removed from automated parking systems in case of power outage or system failure.', ' ', 'The proposed changes provide enhanced flexibility for the use of space-efficient parking in all project types. This would allow parking area to occupy less space in projects providing additional area for residential and commercial uses. Providing more flexibility is tempered by the requirement of attendant services and on-site queuing spaces to limit impacts to the public right-of-way. The proposed changes would also allow tandem parking for residential projects and allow the use of mechanical systems such as stackers and automobile turntables for Single-Unit Dwellings. Parking and Loading Operations Plans would allow the City to assess proposals on a case-by-case basis prior to the issuance of a building permit. The Planning Commission was supportive of the proposed changes. ', ' ', 'Accessory Dwelling Units', 'Through the course of updating the Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) standards in the Zoning Ordinance to make them consistent with recent changes to State law, the Commission had expressed interest in revisiting the maximum size standards for ADUs. The purpose of the ADU maximum size standard is to limit the size of ADUs and ensure they are accessory to the primary residences, and to protect the character of single-unit residential districts. Recent changes in State ADU law are intended to address barriers, streamline approvals, and expand potential capacity for ADUs. ', ' ', 'The proposed changes in the ADU standards in the SMMC attempt to balance all of these goals. The proposed changes separate the ADU standards in SMMC Section 9.31.300 from the Accessory Building and Structures standards found in SMMC Section 9.21.020 to avoid any confusion and conflicts between the standards. Currently, the Zoning Ordinance cross-references both sets of standards in both sections of the Zoning Ordinance. ', ' ', 'The proposed changes increase the maximum size of ADUs to 1,200 square feet and increase the maximum size of a second story of an ADU from 250 square feet to 400 square feet. In reaching this proposal, the Commission discussed recent state guidance as well as the State’s maximum ADU size of 1,200 square feet. The Planning Commission supported a change in maximum ADU size to 1,200 feet but also recommended that other areas of the law that allow local control including, but not limited to, ADU height, setbacks, second story size, and parcel coverage be reviewed as part of the forthcoming effort to review and update the R1 Single-Unit Residential development standards.  ', ' ', 'In Santa Monica, the average size of ADUs submitted for plan check has on average over the last year been between 350-550 square feet, but this is a result of most ADUs being created through the conversion of existing garages and accessory buildings as opposed to new construction. A number of inquiries from the public have been received about the construction of potential new ADUs of approximately 800 square feet, but few building permit applications of this size for new ADUs have been submitted so far. ', ' ', 'Under State law, a city can set a maximum ADU size of up to 1,200 square feet however, the maximum ADU size must not unreasonably burden or restrict ADU development.  Typical maximum ADU sizes, according to written guidance from the Department of Housing and Community Development, range from 800 to 1,200 square feet.  In other local jurisdictions, maximum ADU size varies, with many cities allowing a maximum size of 1,200 square feet; some cities allowing the lesser of 1,200 square feet or some percentage of the size of the existing primary residence; and some cities limiting maximum ADU size to between 500 – 800 square feet.', ' ', 'Staff concurs with the recommendation of the Planning Commission.  With regards to potential concerns about ADU size, there is a requirement that an ADU be clearly subordinate to the main dwelling unit in terms of size, location, and appearance [SMMC Section 9.31.300(G)(1)], which should ensure that ADU size is still in keeping with neighborhood character while allowing flexibility for additional housing.   ', ' ', 'Code Enforcement', 'SMMC Section 9.48.010(A) states the following:', ' ', 'No person shall establish, operate, erect, move, alter, enlarge or maintain any use, activity, or improvement in contravention of any provision of Article 9 of the Municipal Code, including any General, Area, or Specific Plans incorporated by this Article 9.', ' ', 'This provision identifies the various actions related to the Zoning Ordinance that are subject to enforcement procedures. Previous code compliance cases have involved property owners attempting to deflect responsibility of a tenant’s code violation and failure to compel the tenant to comply by arguing their lack of knowledge of particular regulations. Staff has interpreted “maintain” to mean “allow”, however; in recent appeals of short-term rental enforcement actions, the hearing officer has disagreed with staff’s interpretation.  Adding the word “allow” to the list of actions in this section in intended to clarify already existing enforcement policy and seeks to prevent continual violations of regulations by tenants and hold property owners responsible. ', ' ', 'A member of the Planning Commission expressed concerns about holding a third party responsible for someone else’s action, particularly in a landlord/tenant relationship, and any potential unintended consequences that may result. However, throughout the City’s past enforcement of the Municipal Code using parallel provisions, there has been no indication that the enforcement provisions have had any unintended consequences on tenant/landlord relationships. The proposed addition of the word “allow” is particularly necessary to adequately enforce illegal short-term rentals in the effort to protect affordable housing. In consultation with the City Attorney’s Office, it was determined that the proposed change would help achieve this goal as well as provide a broad ability to enforce safety and nuisance violations such as electrical hazards and noise issues. Adding the word “allow” would also clarify the provisions for Administrative Hearing Officers.   ', ' ', 'Staff Recommendation', 'The attached ordinance (Attachment I) recommends that the Council amend the Zoning Ordinance making changes, corrections, and clarifications to the Zoning Ordinance related to policy issues that have arisen since the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance through its implementation. ', ' ', 'Over the next several months, the Planning Commission will discuss potential new policy directions related to the Zoning Ordinance with the anticipation that the Commission will consider potential code changes that may affect previous policy decisions prior to Council consideration.', ' ', 'Environmental Analysis', 'The proposed changes, corrections, and clarifications to the Zoning Ordinance related to policy issues that have arisen since the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance through its implementation are categorically exempt from the provisions of California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to 15061(b)(3) of the State Implementation Guidelines (common sense exemption). Based on the evidence in the record, it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the proposed changes may have a significant effect on the environment. The recommended modifications represent changes, corrections, and clarifications to the Zoning Ordinance related to policy issues that have arisen since the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance through its implementation and that do not substantively affect policy decisions made with the City Council’s adoption of the Zoning Ordinance. Therefore, no further environmental review under CEQA is required.', ' ', 'Text Amendment Findings', '2.                  The Ordinance amendments are consistent with the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the growth of the City in an orderly manner and to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, in that the amendments maintain the existing policies, standards, and regulations of the Zoning Ordinance that promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.', ' ', 'Financial Impacts & Budget Actions ', 'There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of the recommended action.', ' ']}, {'Title': ' Resolution of the City Council making minor amendments to the Civic Center Specific Plan that are consistent with Council’s direction to develop the Civic Center Multipurpose Sports Field and the City’s emphasis on managing and sharing existing parking resources as a whole system.', 'ID': '2955', 'MeetingID': '1141', 'Department': 'Development Review 3', 'Sponsors': None, 'Actions': ['Consider the 7th Addendum to the Civic Center Specific Plan EIR for proposed amendments to the Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) in support of the Civic Center Multipurpose Sports Field; and ', 'Approve amendments to the CCSP, per Attachment A of this report.'], 'Body': ['Executive Summary', 'The Civic Center is the historic heart of an array of public institutions and public spaces serving the Santa Monica community.  After extensive public participation and review, the Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) was adopted in 2005 and included four special use districts: Auditorium, Palisades Garden Walk, Civic Core, and the Village.  Since Plan adoption, the City has diligently and successfully pursued and implemented each component of the CCSP.  A playfield area, which has become the Civic Center Multipurpose Sports Field project, located in the Auditorium Special Use District, has been a component of the Civic Center Specific Plan since it was adopted in 2005.  The field is shown near the intersection of 4th Street and Pico Boulevard and adjacent to the Early Childhood Lab School with construction to begin in June, and the Civic Auditorium. The CCSP contains numerous references to the “Civic Auditorium Park” and includes illustrations depicting the field with a 100’ setback from Pico Boulevard.  ', ' ', 'City Council has taken a series of actions to implement the sports field including authorizing full funding for its design and construction on February 13, 2018.  In order to ensure that this important component of the CCSP is implemented per Council’s direction, minor text clarifications are proposed to the CCSP to explicitly reference the Civic Center Multipurpose Sports Field.  Minor amendments to illustrations showing the sports field are also proposed to allow flexibility in its design.  Further, a minor text amendment to Parking Policy C-5 is proposed to clarify that parking in the Civic Center area is shared among Civic Center uses and can be accommodated in the Civic Center Parking Structure and surrounding public parking facilities. ', ' ', 'The Planning Commission reviewed the proposed amendments at a public hearing on April 18, 2018 and voted 6-0 to recommend that the City Council approve the amendments subject to adding a new policy to the Phasing Program on Page 82 of the CCSP that would ensure that the implementation of the sports field does not preclude the possibility of any underground facilities that may be required for re-activation of the Civic Auditorium.  As discussed more fully in this report, staff does not recommend inclusion of this new policy because staff does not believe that it is necessary to specify how the future activation of the Civic Auditorium might proceed. The major components of the CCSP have been implemented over time without the level of specificity recommended in the new policy.  ', ' ', 'Background', 'On February 9, 2016, in conjunction with City staff’s presentation of the Civic Working Group’s Final Report and proposed next steps for the Civic Auditorium, Council directed staff to explore the possibility of placing a synthetic turf sports field including restroom facilities at the corner of 4th Street and Pico Boulevard, to work with partners such as the Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District (SMMUSD) and Santa Monica College (SMC) on funding options, and to return to Council with cost estimates for design and construction of the field. Since that time, staff have been diligently working to prepare the design and receive the necessary permits for this project, and have returned to Council several more times in the process.', ' ', '·         June 27, 2017 - Following completion of the site analysis and conceptual design study by the City’s consultant RJM, staff presented an economic study, design feasibility analysis and two concept design options for a multipurpose sports field at the Civic Center.

The event attracts approximately 7,000 to 10,000 local and regional attendees to hear live music and to experience the businesses along the one-mile business corridor.  Beginning in 2011, the City has provided funding and staffing assistance to MSBIA for the event’s production.  Staff recommends a memorandum of understanding to define the roles, responsibilities, and contributions of each party.

Starting at Pico Boulevard and extending south to Ocean Park Boulevard, the street would be closed from 10:00 AM to 9:00 PM.  The street closure would not only expand the capacity for public participation in the event, it would also allow for additional activation of the area.  The proposed street closure also increases the costs for staging the event, especially in the areas of public safety and traffic control.  While MSBIA is working to raise additional funding for the event through increased sponsorships and vendors, a funding gap is anticipated.  At its April 10, 2018 meeting, Council allocated an additional $14,000 of its discretionary funds to MSBIA to help offset the additional public safety expense. ', ' ', 'Background', 'The Main Street Business Improvement Association (MSBIA) has produced the Summer Soulstice festival (Soulstice), an annual, free, one-day, live-music event, since 2001.  The event features bands on stages located on several closed side streets along Main Street, as well as an accompanying sidewalk sale by Main Street merchants, and, in some years, an entertainment area for children.  The summer event was organized to celebrate Main Street’s businesses, attract residents and visitors to the area, and expand the entertainment offerings provided at the Sunday Main Street Farmers Market.  The event brings vitality to the street, offers the community an opportunity to enjoy free, live musical entertainment in an outdoor setting, and provides an economic boost to the retailers and restaurants on Main Street.  The Main Street commercial district begins at Pico Boulevard to the north and extends to the southern City boundary, just south of Marine Street.', ' ', 'For many years, MSBIA’s Executive Director and the organization’s board members solely produced and financed the one-day Summer Soulstice event.  As production costs and administrative responsibilities have risen over time, MSBIA has sought participants to help with the administrative duties, as well as sponsors and vendors to help offset the expense.', ' ', 'Beginning in FY 2011-12 and annually thereafter, Council has allocated discretionary funds to support events organized by the business improvement districts (BIDs) that include MSBIA, as well as the Pico Boulevard and Montana Avenue districts.  Downtown Santa Monica, Inc. does not participate in the discretionary funding allocation since it is primarily organized as a property-based assessment district.  MSBIA has used the discretionary funds to cover the City’s fees related to the production of the Soulstice event.  The amount of Council discretionary funds allocated to MSBIA has varied each year.  The City provided $2,500 in FY 2011-12; $3,750 in FY 2012-13, and $7,000 in FY 2013-14.  In FY 2014-15, the amount of discretionary funding was reduced to $4,000 because the City was able to reduce Police and Fire staffing costs associated with the event.  In FY 2015-16 and FY 2016-17, Council provided $7,000 in discretionary funds to MSBIA and to each of the other BIDs.  For FY 2017-18, the City has increased the amount each of the three BIDs receives to $8,000.', ' ', 'In 2011, the City’s Buy Local program began providing partnership grant funds to the three BIDs of up to $1,500 annually.  MSBIA has primarily used the Buy Local grant to help fund some of the Summer Soulstice marketing and promotion costs, as the event helps promote the Buy Local program.', ' ', 'In 2015, the City established an Event Partnership Administrative Instruction (AI) that specified conditions and requirements for City sponsorship and co-production of community events.  The AI authorizes the City to partner with organizations to provide funds, fee waivers, and use of City staff time for planning and implementation of qualified events.  The value of the sponsorship or co-production varies.  The City co-produced the 2015 Summer Soulstice event and MSBIA received approximately $13,604 in City support, comprised of Council discretionary funds, Buy Local funds, fee waivers, fee reductions, and in-kind staff time to contribute to the event’s total expense of approximately $32,000. The City also co-produced the 2016 Soulstice festival, and MSBIA received $16,823 in City support, which included allowing for an over-the-street banner, promotion of the event via the City’s social media outlets, fee waivers, fee reductions, and additional City fees associated with public safety staffing requirements, to help offset the total event expense of approximately $40,000. The value of the City resources provided to MSBIA is based on the actual cost of City fees, as well as staff time. While the City was considered a co-producer for both the 2015 and 2016 Soulstice events, both events were processed by the Community and Cultural Service events program and no MOU was executed.', ' ', 'At its February 28, 2017 meeting, Council authorized staff to enter into a MOU with MSBIA to co-produce the 2017 Soulstice festival (Attachment A).  MSBIA received $19,313 of City support in the form of expense reimbursement, in-kind staff assistance, and some fee waivers to contribute towards the total event expense of approximately $66,000.  The City’s increased support in 2017 was primarily due to a change in the City’s parking-rate structure for reserving spaces in the City parking lots.', ' ', 'The Soulstice festival is a signature event for MSBIA and the Main Street commercial district.  The City has historically welcomed the opportunity to co-produce the event because it aligns with several City’s goals.  For example, the event draws a broad audience that includes both locals and regional visitors of all ages.  The festival also brings the community together and creates a sense of connection where attendees can gather and socialize.  In addition, the event allows attendees to explore Main Street stores and restaurants, and encourages spending locally, thereby supporting Economic Opportunity. ', ' ', 'Discussion', 'For several years, MSBIA has been interested in the closure of Main Street in conjunction with Soulstice in order to expand the event program area and increase pedestrian circulation.  Due to the success of COAST, the open-streets event the City produced in 2016 and 2017, MSBIA requested the closure of Main Street for the 2017 Soulstice.  Staff determined that a variety of internal policies and requirements would need to be addressed in order to permit the closure of Main Street and that there was insufficient time to do so prior to the 2017 event.  While evaluating the closure of Main Street from Pico Boulevard to the southern City boundary for the 2018 Soulstice, a closure of Main Street from Pico to Ocean Park Boulevard was agreed upon between staff and MSBIA.  The 2018 Soulstice festival will be held on June 24, 2018.  Main Street will be closed to vehicle traffic beginning at Pico Boulevard, and extending south to Ocean Park Boulevard from 10:00AM to 9:00PM.  The street closure allows for additional activations, and it will provide attendees a new way to interact and experience the businesses along Main Street.    The Ocean Park Association expressed their support for the closure of Main Street as part of the 2018 Soulstice.', ' ', 'The street closure also increases the costs for staging the event because of the increased requirements for public safety and traffic control.  For 2018’s Soulstice, water barricades will be required at a cost of approximately $15,000; the costs for fire and medical personnel is estimated at $7,800, an increase of $6,500 from the 2017 Soulstice; and additional traffic control and police cost is estimated at $5,100, an increase of $2,200 from 2017. The public safety expenses add up to a total of $27,900 in production costs, an increase of $23,700 over 2017’s costs.', ' ', 'While MSBIA has been working to offset the increased costs by increasing the number of sponsors and vendors, at its April 10, 2018 meeting, Council allocated an additional $14,000 in discretionary funds to help with the additional public safety and traffic control expenses.

Staff anticipates that the amount of City support for the 2018 Soulstice will be higher than what was provided in 2017 due to the increased expenses associated with the street closure.

The proposed ordinance would reduce harmful effects of evictions and promote continuity in education by preventing no-fault evictions of families with children and educators during the school year.  The proposed ordinance also makes clerical changes to Article 4 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code by moving certain existing tenant protection provisions in Article 4 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code to a new chapter titled Tenant Protection.  These clerical changes are intended to promote transparency and ease access to the law.', ' ', 'Background', 'On February 27, 2018, the City Council directed staff to prepare an ordinance to limit no-fault evictions against students and educators during the school year. The request was made in the context of a continuing affordable housing crisis in the City, concern for housing-related disruptions to children’s education, and guidance from a recent U.S. Court of Appeal decision affirming a similar law in San Francisco.  As detailed below, no-fault evictions occur when tenants are evicted based on no fault of their own but due to a landlord’s decision to, for example, occupy the property or exit the rental market.  ', ' ', 'Discussion', 'No-fault evictions occur year-round, but those occurring for families during the school year are of particular concern due to the adverse effect on children. Studies demonstrate that moving or changing schools in the middle of the school year can be harmful for children. See, for example, “Moving Matters: The Causal Effect of Moving Schools on Student Performance” (2017) The MIT Press, Vol. 12, Issue 4, p. 419-446 (citing twenty-seven previous studies and articles); Veronique Dupere’s “School Mobility and school-age children’s social adjustment”, Developmental Psychology 51(2): 197-210 (2015).', ' ', "Mid-year moves are more likely to disrupt children's peer networks and interfere with the learning process; and school year mobility is also linked to decreased proficiency rates on standardized test performances.", ' ', 'The impact of no-fault evictions during the school year on school staff, especially teachers, also raises serious concern. School staff tend to be especially vulnerable to displacement due to salary limitations that can make it difficult to quickly or easily locate replacement housing. Moreover, the eviction of school staff during the school year can cause significant harm to a child’s education. Children need strong mentoring relationships to succeed and often turn to school staff, particularly when they cannot find stability in their homes or in their communities. Academic performance suffers when teachers and other significant staff leave or are repeatedly absent during the school year. Thus, mid-year evictions of teachers and staff disrupt relationships that are important to children, interfere with the learning process, and burden our schools. ', ' ', "The proposed ordinance draws on and is based upon significant work done by the City and County of San Francisco to study the effects of and take steps to mitigate the harm of school-year evictions of children and educators.  In April 2016, following extensive study and findings, San Francisco adopted Ordinance No. 55-16 to create a substantive defense to no-fault evictions of students and educators.  On February 14, 2018, the California Court of Appeal upheld that Ordinance in a published opinion; on April 25, 2018, the California Supreme Court declined to review this decision.  See San Francisco Apartment Association et al. v City and County of San Francisco (2018) 20 Cal. App. 5th 510.  See also, Birkenfeld v. City of Berkeley (1976) 17 Cal.3d 129, 149 (city's exercise of the police power creating a substantive eviction defense does not conflict with the state's unlawful detainer statutory scheme).

Currently, weight limit signs are posted only for the Santa Monica Municipal Pier and Newcomb Pier, both of which are entirely under the City’s jurisdiction. Upon receiving this recommendation, staff conducted a review and developed revised weight limits for the piers and the bridge. Staff recommends amending local law to authorize the City Engineer to set updated vehicle weight limits based on study and assessment.  Based on the City Engineer’s most recent study and assessment, staff recommends increasing the posted weight limit for the Santa Monica Pier to 15 tons and setting a weight limit of 3 tons for the Newcomb Pier. Staff further recommends that Council conduct a public hearing, on behalf of Los Angeles County and at the County’s request, to determine the weight limit for the Pier Bridge.

The signs are posted at both the top and bottom approaches to the Pier Bridge and, by inference, limited the loads for the Pier Bridge. The photo to the left shows the sign located at the top of the Pier Bridge. Notwithstanding the load limits posted for the Municipal Pier and the Newcomb Pier, the LACDPW noted that their structural analysis required a load limit to be posted for the Pier Bridge itself. In order to legally post a load limit for a bridge, the California Vehicle Code requires that a public hearing be held and an ordinance be adopted under the County’s direction.', ' ', 'Discussion', 'The LACDPW performed load rating calculations for the Pier Bridge, which indicated the safe load capacity of the structure to be:', ' ', '·         22 tons per truck', '·         22 tons per truck and semi-trailer combination', '·         30 tons per truck and full trailer combination', ' ', 'The LACDPW recommends that the bridge be posted for a weight limit not to exceed 22 tons. However, this exceeds the load capacities of the Municipal Pier (outlined in blue below in Figure 1) and the Newcomb Pier (outlined in orange below in Figure 1). The sole purpose of the Pier Bridge is to provide vehicle and pedestrian access to the Municipal and Newcomb Piers. There are no other adjoining structures or access points to the Pier Bridge.

The Municipal and Newcomb Piers have had signs posted for maximum weights of 10 and 3 tons, respectively, for nearly a decade or longer. Staff researched as-built plans and records for past upgrade and maintenance projects for the Municipal Pier and concluded that the lowest rated section, a 200-foot-long concrete waffle structure at the west end, could support a 15-ton vehicle. The rest of the structure is rated for a 20-ton vehicle. Based on the controlling capacity of the waffle structure, staff recommends that the Municipal Pier and the adjoining Pier Bridge be posted for a weight limit not to exceed 15 tons.  ', ' ', 'The 2008 Pier Infrastructure Assessment Study by Moffatt & Nichol (Study) examined the Newcomb Pier and subdivided it into sections based on the varying substructure types and corresponding load limits. The Study further identified that the lowest rated section can support a 3-ton vehicle. Therefore, staff recommends the Newcomb Pier, where the pier deck parking lot is located, be posted for a weight limit not to exceed 3 tons.', ' ', 'The City has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate Pier weight limitations. Accordingly, the proposed amendment updates the previously codified weight limit for the Municipal Pier and codifies the weight limit for the Newcomb Pier.', ' ', 'Community Events', 'For many years, the Newcomb Pier has served as a venue for community events and will likely continue to accommodate events moving forward, as reflected in the Pier Corporation’s calendar (santamonicapier.org/events). A community event permit is required for these events.  Many of these events require the use of vehicles that exceed the 3-ton weight limit during setup and takedown. To this point, heavy vehicle activity historically has been coordinated with harbor guards, who ensured heavy vehicles did not enter the weaker sections of the Newcomb Pier. Codifying the 3-ton weight limit would make it illegal for a vehicle exceeding 3-tons to enter the Newcomb Pier for any reason other than an emergency, subsequently precluding many community events. To continue accommodating community events, the proposed amendment includes an exemption for vehicles that are issued a permit, and a permit would be required for events that utilize vehicles heavier than 3 tons. Heavy vehicle activity would continue to be monitored by harbor guards.', ' ', 'Pier Bridge', 'Unlike the Piers, which are under the City’s exclusive jurisdiction, California Vehicle Code Section 35751(a) grants only Los Angeles County the authority to set weight limitations on the Pier Bridge. Consistent with Section 35751 and longstanding practice, the County has cooperated with Santa Monica and other cities within the County to set bridge load limits. Additionally, Section 35751 requires a public hearing be held before the Pier Bridge’s weight limit could be reduced beyond what the Vehicle Code otherwise requires. The County has requested that the City conduct this hearing on the County’s behalf. Upon conclusion of the hearing, staff would transmit the City’s weight recommendations to the County and work with the County to set the correct weight limit.

Nine of the eleven peers, including Santa Monica, showed high employee tenure. According to the study, the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that local government employee tenure is 8.3 years, while the private sector median is 3.7 years. Longer tenure is noted as a factor in higher total compensation costs.

The recommended first option is to not place a measure on the ballot and continue to rely on the existing General Plan, the Downtown Community Plan and Zoning Ordinance which sets out clear rules for maximum height and floor-area ratios (FAR) for the vast majority of the City based on plans adopted after robust public input. Option 2 would allow projects to exceed the zoning ordinance standards through a Development Agreement without a super-majority, but only if the project is consistent with the LUCE and any applicable Specific Plan. Option 3 would require a super-majority for any project that exceeds the height and FAR allowance contained in the zoning ordinance.', ' ', 'Having completed the implementation of the Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) in 2010 with the adoption of the citywide Zoning Ordinance and the Downtown Community Plan, the flexibility utilized for development agreements is no longer either necessary or desirable.  Predictability for both property owners and residents outweighs the perceived benefits that came from negotiating heights and density on a project by project basis.  Having put enormous resources of time, debate and financial resources into establishing specific height and density limitations for the entire city, Council has clearly indicated a commitment to enforce those limits by applying them consistently to all future projects and that has been the established practice without deviation since the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance and the Downtown Community Plan.', ' ', 'Discussion', 'Development in Santa Monica is governed by a Tier system, which is contained in the LUCE and establishes up to three tiers of development in most land use districts. Tier 1 development is limited to a relatively low height and FAR with a very predictable entitlement process. Tier 2 development allows greater height and FAR in exchange for increased, but prescribed community benefits. Tier 3 development allows the most height and FAR in exchange for community benefits beyond what is required for Tier 2 projects. ', ' ', 'Under current requirements, development can only exceed height or FAR requirements established in the Zoning Ordinance, LUCE and/or any Specific Plan if the relevant governing document is amended, or, in limited circumstances, if a Development Agreement is obtained. Any such amendment or Development Agreement must be adopted by ordinance and is subject to referendum and reversal by the voters.', ' ', 'Prior to adoption of the Zoning Ordinance and associated amendments to the LUCE in 2015 and the Downtown Community Plan last year, most projects proceeded by Development Agreement, which allowed increased height and FAR in exchange for community benefits.  The Zoning Ordinance and the Downtown Community Plan, however, implemented prescribed development standards and community benefits for Tier 2 projects; and the Downtown Community Plan includes prescribed development standards and community benefits for most Tier 3 housing projects.  ', ' ', 'Today, there are only limited areas in the City where Tier 3 projects with negotiated height and FAR are still allowed. These include Broadway and Colorado Avenue between Lincoln and 20th Street, the area bounded by Broadway to the north, Colorado to the south, Cloverfield to the east and 20th Street to the west, and any project in the Mixed Use Boulevard Low District that includes 100% affordable housing or a designated Landmark. Tier 3 projects are also allowed by Development Agreement in portions of the Bergamot Transit Village. However, while these projects could exceed the height and FAR limits in the zoning ordinance, they must be consistent with the height and FAR maximums contained in the LUCE.', ' ', 'Option 1', 'Option 1 would retain and reinforce existing legally adopted development rules and requirements.  With the adoption of the Downtown Community Plan in 2016 and the citywide Zoning Ordinance in 2015, Council clearly established height and FAR ratios to guide future development throughout the City with the intent of providing certainty about the rules for property owners, residents and potential developers.  Under existing rules, development may not exceed established height or FAR requirements.  Deviating from those standards would require amending the governing document ordinance (or the governing document permits a Development Agreement, also adopted by ordinance). In either case, any such ordinance adopted by Council would be subject to referendum by the voters.  Council may therefore conclude that an additional super-majority requirement is not necessary given that the Council has intentionally adopted the prescribed development requirements set forth in recent years and shown a clear commitment to regulating development within those standards.  The availability of referendum for any change to height or FAR requirements in the Zoning Ordinance or area specific plan or any Development Agreement allowing development in excess of prescribed height and FAR limits provides strong protection that these rules will be enforced and not set on a project by project basis.  It should be noted that the City is not required to even process a proposal for a development agreement that exceeds zoning standards.  Staff believes that adhering to the established zoning standards makes enacting a charter amendment unnecessary to ensure consistent compliance with established height and FAR standards.', ' ', 'Options 2 and 3', ' ', 'In response to Council direction to explore options to require a super-majority, or other process, for development exceeding the adopted General Plan or Zoning Ordinance height or FAR allowances, staff has developed two additional options for Council consideration.

To promote community, encourage public visitation and use, and help ensure that the Promenade (including in particular its northernmost block) remains vibrant, inviting, and safe, staff recommends that the City enter into a pilot-program license agreement with Downtown Santa Monica, Inc. (DTSM) to provide public-serving programs and amenities on the Promenade, with a focus on its 1200 block between Arizona Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard. The duration of the pilot-program license agreement would be for an initial term of one year with up to four one-year renewal options on the same terms and conditions, for a total license term of up to five years, without a license fee. ', ' ', 'Background', 'The Third Street Promenade’s public spaces have become important community gathering places and a significant contributor to the success of the Promenade and Santa Monica’s Downtown. In 1989, the City and downtown property owners had the foresight to invest in creating enhanced public spaces, which included the renovation of the public right-of-way and the addition of a variety of streetscape elements. Residents and visitors have been drawn to the Promenade’s unique urban setting, which features street performers, restaurants and outdoor dining, specialty merchandise, entertainment venues, flexible plazas, welcoming ambassadors, and enhanced maintenance services. The bustling, colorful scene along the Promenade provides a safe place for community gathering that encourages repeat visitation and supports a healthy mix of retail, restaurant, and entertainment uses.  Research and experience in Santa Monica and nationally demonstrate the value of “placemaking” to promote community gathering spaces that are shared and welcoming, and that as a result are also safer.', ' ', 'The most northern of the three blocks, the 1200 block of the Promenade located between Arizona Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard, has traditionally not generated the same level of visitation and pedestrian activity as the Promenade’s other two blocks for a variety of reasons, including its distance from the Santa Monica Pier, Santa Monica Place, and key transportation access points such as the I-10 Freeway and more recently, the Expo light-rail terminus. Additionally, the Barnes & Noble bookstore at the southeast corner of Third Street and Wilshire Boulevard, which served as an anchor for the 1200 block of the Promenade for over 20 years, closed in January 2018, citing the need to downsize their store space and seek a more affordable location. Given the recent trends in retail and increasing competition from online retailers, the closing was unfortunate for downtown, though not unexpected.  Other retail closings have occurred throughout the Promenade, and these, coupled with a growing movement towards e-commerce, have contributed to decreased visitation and pedestrian activity in the Promenade as a whole. ', ' ', 'DTSM has prioritized business retention and recruitment to address changing consumer preferences and the continued competition of online sales. DTSM’s Board of Directors created the Promenade Tenancy Committee in 2017 for the purpose of vetting proposed programs, strategies, and tactics designed to support downtown’s retail, restaurant, entertainment, and other active uses. DTSM has also identified the need to expand the level of public-serving amenities to increase visitation and pedestrian activity and attract patrons to support the area’s businesses. As Promenade businesses compete with internet commerce, as well as other retail destinations like The Grove and the newly renovated Westfield Century City, DTSM has sought to differentiate Downtown Santa Monica and the Promenade.  One element of differentiation is creating interactive, people-focused experiences that are not available elsewhere, and which buttress the Promenade’s identification by the public as a safe and entertaining community gathering space. DTSM has enhanced the Promenade’s public spaces by creating engaging activities and installations, such as the Picnic on the Promenade summer activities and December’s holiday pop-up art installation.  ', ' ', 'The City has a history of sensitivity to concerns about privatizing public space.  While traditional malls and newer “lifestyle centers” like the Grove exert private property rights over their circulation and gathering spaces, historic commercial areas in revitalized urban areas are genuinely public spaces.  Working in partnership with a non-profit, stakeholder-based organization like DTSM offers an opportunity to animate and manage public spaces while ensuring public access and, indeed, increasing their attractiveness as community gathering spaces.  DTSM has been granted other licenses to activate the City’s public spaces such as the very successful ice rink at 5th Street and Arizona Avenue. DTSM has also entered into pilot-program license agreements to provide public-serving amenities along Ocean Avenue near Tongva Park and public art installations at Triangle Square adjacent to the Colorado Esplanade. ', ' ', 'The Ocean Avenue activation is being permitted and is expected to begin by early summer. The downtown public art installation programming, in partnership with Community and Cultural Services, is planned to continue through Labor Day 2018. The City also entered into a pilot program to establish DTSM ambassador services in Tongva and Palisades Parks to provide hospitality services, assist with monitoring and maintenance of the spaces, and address quality of life issues. The initial success of these programs have created a positive impact on visitors’ perception of safety and cleanliness, and demonstrated the value of “placemaking” to promote shared, welcoming environments, which in turn enhances safety and helps to create more vibrant public spaces. ', ' ', 'Discussion', 'With the continued growth of online shopping, customers who have traditionally been lured by brand names and new products are seeking more of an "experience" in a commercial district, rather than simply a place to shop. In an effort to keep the Promenade competitive and fresh in the public’s perception, to continue to offer a unique and attractive public community experience to both residents and visitors in one of the City’s key public spaces, and to help sustain one of the City’s economic engines, DTSM proposes to activate the Promenade (particularly its 1200 block) by offering public-serving amenities and other interactive experiences that enhance the sense of place and engage the community. The City has initiated the process of developing a strategy to sustain Santa Monica’s vibrant economy as technology and globalism rapidly change the way we live and work.  One possible focus of the strategy is to address how e-commerce is impacting the retail environment. Even though the full extent of the impact to the retail environment is unknown at this time, studies and experiential efforts have shown that consumers are increasingly adopting the convenience of online shopping while seeking personal experiences such as dining or interactive retail experiences. To curate a great downtown environment and to continue to support a vibrant public space for community engagement, there is a growing need to provide an engaging environment that heightens the public’s experience.   ', ' ', 'Based on DTSM’s experience and success with programming activities and events, staff recommends entering into a pilot-program license agreement with DTSM to assist with increasing pedestrian experiences on the Promenade, with a focus on its north block. The proposed pilot-program license agreement would allow DTSM to provide pedestrian-oriented services and amenities within the Promenade, with a focus on the approximately 4,800-square-foot public plaza of the 1200 block of the Promenade, exclusive of any existing outdoor-dining license areas. Activation of the area with pedestrian-oriented amenities, experiential activities, and event programming is intended to help create connections between the north and south ends of the Promenade, increase overall public visitation (including in particular increased pedestrian activity at the north end of the Promenade), develop a greater sense of place, and build community. The goals and objectives align with the guiding principles of the Downtown Community Plan.  ', ' ', 'The terms of the license agreement are recommended to allow DTSM to program the Promenade daily from approximately 7 AM until 10 PM. DTSM staff and ambassadors would be allowed to set up the following, all of which would be available to the public for use:', '·         Tables, chairs, umbrellas, and other moveable furniture ', '·         Games and interactive displays such as pianos and ping-pong tables', '·         Dog treats and water bowls', '·         Audio system and staging (for use by musicians, DJs, and performers who have obtained required permits, with scheduling as necessary by DTSM) ', '·         Additional trashcans and recycle bins', ' ', 'The terms of the recommended license agreement would also permit DTSM, during the same hours and in the same space, to have ambassadors or staff available to assist public use of the provided amenities.  DTSM would also be allowed to post signage, bearing both DTSM’s and the City’s logos, promoting the Promenade as a public gathering space.  ', ' ', 'As part of the pilot program, staff recommends that DTSM be provided with the flexibility and creativity to adjust the types of programs and uses within the license area that are most impactful to enhancing the public’s experience and attracting increased public visitation.  In turn, DTSM would provide regular reports to the City detailing the success of various programs and uses in increasing foot traffic and community engagement.  DTSM would also study the use of temporary seating by observing the way people interact with moveable furniture.  Staff seeks administrative discretion to modify the scope of DTSM services within the license agreement to respond to the success of programs and uses in enhancing community engagement and promoting a unique downtown public environment.   ', ' ', 'DTSM will also continue to obtain event permits pursuant to the generally applicable events permitting process to provide additional public community engagement activities, at times co-sponsored by local businesses.  As DTSM learns the relative success of various programs, DTSM may seek to enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the City to present additional events outside of that process to further the City’s goals.   Staff anticipates presenting any such MOU to the Council for approval.

In contrast, transitioning to a battery electric transit fleet yields a 68% reduction from the baseline scenario. While this is a significant percent reduction, the PM emissions from each of the scenarios is very small because natural gas engines have extremely low PM10 emissions.', ' ', 'In summary, the analysis found that, at an incremental cost of approximately $4 million, the transition of BBB’s existing fleet to a fleet of near-zero NOx emission natural gas transit buses would result in a small decrease in GHG emissions and a significant reduction in TTW NOx emissions. At an incremental cost of approximately $78 million, the transition of BBB’s existing fleet to battery electric transit buses would result in GHG and TTW NOx emissions reductions that are more costly compared to those achieved from the deployment of near-zero NOx emission natural gas transit buses.', ' ', 'The results of the analysis are based on projections of significant operating cost reductions for battery electric buses over time. These reductions are based on large reductions in battery storage costs and projections of revenue from the LCFS program. Changes in these assumptions would have a dramatic impact on the total estimated project costs. Were battery storage costs to remain constant (and not fall over time as they almost certainly will based on history), the incremental cost of converting the entire fleet to battery electric buses would increase to approximately $130 million as opposed to approximately $78 million.', ' ', 'The LCFS program works with other programs in California, such as the Cap-and-Trade Program, to reduce transportation-related GHG emissions. Credits are generated from the use of low carbon fuels in the transportation sector. Regulated entities, such as petroleum refiners, are required to purchase credits to offset the GHG emissions associated with the higher carbon fuels that they produce. It is the demand for these credits by regulated entities that sets the credit price. Though the credit price has remained stable in recent years, future credit prices would be established in an open market environment and any fluctuations in the price of the credit would directly impact BBB’s cost of operating battery electric buses. ', ' ', 'Funding Opportunities', 'With the proposed 23-year length of a transition to a zero emission fleet, it is impossible to accurately predict what the funding landscape would look like. However, this section describes existing federal, state, and county programs and incentives outside of BBB’s ongoing funding streams that could help pay for alternatively-fuelled buses. ', ' ', 'The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) offers two relatively small funding pots for the purchase of zero-emission transit buses. The Low or No Emission Competitive Program (LoNo) provides funding to state and local governmental authorities for the purchase or lease of zero-emission and low-emission transit buses as well as acquisition, construction, and leasing of required supporting facilities. The LoNo Program distributes $55 million nationwide. Big Blue Bus applied for funding for battery electric buses in the FTA’s last funding cycle but was not selected. ', ' ', 'The FTA also offers the Bus & Bus Facilities Infrastructure Investment Program which allows agencies to replace, rehabilitate and purchase buses and related equipment and to construct bus-related facilities including technological changes or innovations to modify low or no emission vehicles or facilities. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program distributes $226 million nationally. BBB currently submitted an application for the purchase of seven battery electric vehicles through this program but was not selected.', ' ', 'The state’s funding opportunities for zero and near zero engines have been increasing in recent years. For example, the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (HVIP) provides vouchers to help California fleets purchase advanced technology trucks and buses. HVIP provides vouchers for California purchasers and lessees of hybrid and zero-emission trucks and buses on a first-come, first-served basis. Purchasers of fixed route zero emission buses receive $110,000 per vehicle while using near zero engines receive $10,000 to offset costs. BBB would utilize these vouchers regardless of the fuel path chosen. ', ' ', 'To help with the implementation costs of the ICT regulation, the ARB has recently proposed to invest one-third of the VW Mitigation Trust in zero-emission buses. The program would create a maximum incentive of up to $180,000 for a new battery electric transit bus, up to $400,000 for a new fuel cell electric transit bus, and up to $100,000 for a new battery electric shuttle bus. These maximum funding amounts exceed the maximum funding amounts allowed under HVIP. Unfortunately, no funding is proposed for charging infrastructure.', ' ', 'In January, the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) approved the first transportation electrification applications under SB 350 from the three large investor-owned utilities. The decision approves 15 projects with combined budgets of $42 million statewide. One approved project in Southern California Edison’s (SCE) area is $3.9 million for “Electric Transit Bus Make-Ready.” SCE would deploy make-ready infrastructure at bus depots and along bus routes to serve electric commuter buses operating in SCE’s service territory. SCE would also provide a rebate to participating customers to cover the cost of the charging equipment and installation. SCE would maximize the electric transit bus routes it supports in disadvantaged communities.', ' ', 'The California State Transportation Agency has recently finished accepting applications for the next round of Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program (TIRCP). The TIRCP aims to increase ridership on the state-wide transit and rail network and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The five-year program is anticipated to distribute $2.4 billion. Big Blue Bus recently submitted a grant application to CALSTA asking for $3.05 million to pay for the incremental cost of ten 40-foot battery electric buses. The total cost of the ten vehicle program would be $9.7 million. Associated infrastructure costs were not included in the request in order to make the application more competitive.', ' ', 'At the County level, BBB’s participation in Metro’s Bus Operations Subcommittee (BOS) allows it to apply for bus replacements and facility improvements. The BOS distributes 15% of Los Angeles County’s Federal 5307 Capital funds on an annual basis. Typically, the fund source spreads approximately $17 million among the sixteen Municipal Operators. The funds are allocated based on a competitive process. ', ' ', 'Context for All-Electric Fleet Conversion', 'With over 200 public transit systems operating about 14,000 buses, the State of California is leading the way nationally in making the commitment to an all zero-emission fleet. Within the state, seven transit agencies have committed to making full transition to an all-electric fleet by the year 2030. LA Metro currently has 100 zero-emission vehicles on order, and has committed to the conversion if their new vehicles comply with performance benchmarks. Foothill Transit and the City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) have also made the same commitment to have an all zero-emission fleet by 2030. Foothill Transit has 30 zero-emission buses on the road; Long Beach Transit has 10. LADOT has four vehicles on the road and recently ordered 25 more zero emission vehicles. Antelope Valley Transit Authority (AVTA) has eight buses on the street and an order placed for all 85 of their buses to be battery electric by the end of 2019. Elsewhere in the United States, King County Metro in Seattle has committed to purchasing 120 all electric battery buses by 2020 with the goal of having a 100% zero emission fleet between 2034 and 2040. ', ' ', 'The number of manufacturers currently providing battery electric buses is limited but the number is growing as more transit systems commit to the new technology. Two battery electric only bus manufacturers - Proterra and BYD - currently sell most of the battery electric buses across the United States. Other legacy bus manufacturers such as New Flyer and Gillig are also entering the battery electric marketplace. ', ' ', "The most exhaustive study of battery electric bus performance was completed in June 2017 by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory on twelve Foothill Transit buses. The study compared the performance of Proterra battery electric buses versus Foothill's NABI CNG vehicles as a baseline. Highlights of the study include: the twelve battery electric buses accumulating more than 900,000 miles during the study period; the buses surpassed their target of 4,000 miles between road calls with more than 6,000 miles during the evaluation period; the on-route chargers operated reliably with minimal issues; and the high voltage batteries showed little to no sign of capacity degradation during the study period. ", ' ', 'Conversely, the short-range on-route charged buses are inflexible and cannot be deployed to other routes; the higher use of air conditioning lowers the effective range in hotter months; charger availability is needed for successful vehicle deployment; and the CNG buses did significantly outperform the battery electric bus in many of the evaluation areas.  For comparison, BBB’s miles between road failures on the CNG and LNG fleets are more than 18,000 miles. Additionally, systems in Albuquerque, NM, and Long Beach have experienced significant delays in BEB deliveries from vendors, delaying new projects that both systems had intended to launch in early 2017.', ' ', 'Based upon proactive discussions with Southern California Edison, and through staff evaluation of the proposed SCE medium- and heavy-duty vehicle charging infrastructure that includes transit agencies, staff has identified up to 23 potential charging unit locations within the maintenance/parking yard where BEBs could be charged overnight.  ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'BBB all-Electric Fleet Challenges', 'One of the many challenges with converting the fleet to electric is operational and maintenance continuity of operations.  As buses become eligible for replacement under the FTA funding regulations that BBB follows, transitioning and operating a dual fueled fleet becomes complex. During the conversion, more space would be needed for infrastructure required to support charging the BBB electric fleet, while still maintaining RNG fueling facilities for the CNG fleet including giving consideration to back-up power and energy storage.  As BBB is already constrained by the size of the yard and facilities from which it operates, a feasibility and transition analysis would need to be conducted to inform staff and stakeholders on best practices and how to ensure that service delivery to BBB’s 54,000 daily customers remains consistent.', ' ', 'Other challenges and critical areas that need to be reviewed prior to transition to an all-electric fleet include: training of mechanic staff on new fleet propulsion technology; route specific energy analysis; impacts of a replacement analysis greater that one-to-one for electric buses; and the evaluation of electric bus technology advancements and reduced battery costs that are hard to accurately predict.  While these challenges exist, there are many opportunities for growth of BBB’s understanding of electric bus technology.    ', ' ', 'BBB Transition Plan', 'Understanding the unknowns, benefits, costs, tradeoffs, and the City’s desire to move toward an all-electric fleet, staff continues to responsibly and conscientiously prepare and plan for that transition.  ', ' ', 'To address the electric bus fleet and new infrastructure costs, staff continues to seek additional funding for both, applying for new federal and state programs for this technology, as well as meeting with SCE to learn about their new programs. As mentioned earlier, a TIRCP grant has been submitted to partially fund up to ten new electric vehicles.  BBB anticipates announcement of successful grant applications by May 2018. Previous grant submittals for FTA LoNo funding and Bus and Bus Infrastructure Program funding were not successful. Staff has scheduled a conference call with FTA staff on 4/20/18 to discuss our recent grant submittals and how to improve future grant applications.', ' ', 'Staff continues to work with American Public Transportation Association, California Transit Association and sister agencies to maintain the pulse and knowledge of the market. Locally, staff has joined the LA Regional Electric Bus Working Group to collaboratively work with our peers to find solutions for implementation and to the increased costs of this technology. Staff is also working on the Zero Emission Bus Procurement Committee to provide input to the State Department of General Services (DGS) for the creation of a statewide electric bus procurement, giving us options to buy our buses as funding comes in. Additionally, we are in dialogue with Southern California Edison (SCE) to layout plans and estimate costs for converting our property to support a 100% electric fleet.  In those conversations, we have learned of SCE’s work with the CPUC for potential funding for infrastructure. We would continue to monitor all funding possibilities.  ', ' ', 'Finally, BBB has initiated a collaborative effort with FTA, Gillig and the Honolulu Transit System to test one of Gillig’s five total prototype battery electric buses that they are building at the end of this calendar year. In June or early July 2018, staff will recommend to council procurement of one prototype electric bus. This pilot project would help BBB immediately begin to evaluate the technology and the application of operating an electric bus within our service area and how it would impact our operations as we transition to an electric fleet. ', ' ', 'Following best practices, we would perform route, charge and rate modeling to better prepare for a future implementation plan. This process would ultimately help staff understand the differences of this technology and how best to procure, deploy and operate electric buses into the BBB fleet mix. Staff would continue efforts with our funding partners to apply for grants to fund electric bus purchases.', ' ', 'Financial Impacts & Budget Actions ', 'There is no immediate financial impact or budget action associated with conducting the study session.

The project was presented to the ARB at its November 21, 2016 meeting.  The project design was generally well-received with the ARB expressing support of the project massing and acknowledging that the location of the new mixed-use project is challenging due to the site configuration and topography. While the ARB was positive regarding the overall direction of the project, there were some concerns expressed regarding certain aspects of the design.  Staff expressed similar concerns with the overall project design and met with the applicant to convey these concerns.  While the applicant responded to some of the ARB and staff comments, there were several other substantive design comments provided by the Architectural Review Board that were not addressed. In particular, the design strategy along the Lincoln Boulevard frontage is one of a repetition of forms and the pedestrian orientation of the Wilson and Ashland elevations should be improved.

', 'Appeal Summary', 'The appellant filed a timely appeal on January 24, 2018.  The appellant’s appeal statement (Attachment G) raises many specific points as to why the appeal should be approved and DRP 16ENT-0034 denied by Council.  In summary, the appeal statement raises concerns regarding: (1) the public comment and hearing process, (2) consistency with the LUCE, (3) compliance with the Zoning Ordinance, (4) application of the Housing Accountability Act (HAA), (5) compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, (6) traffic impacts, (7) construction impacts, and (8) concerns about CIM Group.  ', ' ', 'Appeal Analysis', 'Staff has reviewed the issues raised by the appellant’s Statement of Appeal and provides the following analysis and responses:  ', ' ', '1.              Public Hearing Process', 'A.              The appellant states that the Brown Act was violated because the supplemental staff report was posted the day of the public hearing.', ' ', 'The agenda for the January 10, 2018 Planning Commission meeting was posted at least 72 hours in advance of the meeting.  The Brown Act does not require posting of staff reports (or supplemental staff reports); however, the City provides staff reports for the public’s benefit along with the posting of the agenda and did so for this meeting.  The supplemental Planning Commission staff report was provided in direct response to a request received from a Planning Commissioner prior to the hearing.  The Commissioners requested that staff explain the applicability of the Housing Accountability Act (HAA) to the review of the project.  As a result, the supplemental staff report was issued providing background on the HAA.  ', 'B.                 The appellant states that the staff report contained errors and that the project should have been denied based on oral and written testimony.', ' ', 'The Planning Commission approved the DRP based on the findings set forth in the Planning Commission STOA as well as the oral and written testimony presented prior to or during the public hearing.  Council reviews the project de novo.  Staff recommends approval of the DRP based on the findings set forth in the draft STOA.', ' ', 'C.              The appellant states that the public was not sufficiently apprised of the project or offered sufficient opportunity for public comment.  Specifically: the “Santa Monica system of neighbors meeting with developers is deeply flawed” and “Planning staff did not subsequently advise neighbors about the ramifications of possible design changes.” ', ' ', 'Although not required as part of the application review process, staff strongly encourages project applicants to conduct neighborhood meetings with affected neighborhood groups and to keep them up to date on project revisions and status. The applicant stated that they presented the project to the Friends of Sunset Park Association on September 15, 2016 and July 10, 2017 and to the Ocean Park Association on November 11, 2016 and June 12, 2017. The applicant further stated that they conducted a full design presentation (including updates) at both meetings.  The circulation change to move primary access to Lincoln Boulevard instead of Ashland Avenue was informed predominantly by staff’s review of existing conditions in addition to concerns expressed by residents early in the process.  Staff worked extensively with the applicant to re-design the project’s circulation and access in order to minimize impacts on Ashland Avenue.  ', ' ', 'D.              The Planning Commission staff report erroneously stated that "staff had not received any comments or concerns from the public at the time the staff report was being drafted."', ' ', 'At the time the Planning Commission staff report was drafted, staff had not received any comments from the public regarding the project. Staff did not receive any written correspondence from either Friends of Sunset Park Association or Ocean Park Association until after the required public notices were delivered. Once received, all written correspondence was presented to the Planning Commission prior to the public hearing.  The Planning Commission also received public testimony during the hearing.  Staff accepts public input at any time during the project review process and if requested will provide updates to nearby neighborhood groups and residents.', '2.              Consistency with the LUCE ', ' ', 'A.                 Appellant states that the project is inconsistent with LUCE guidelines related to General Commercial, Quality of Life, Design Compatibility, Building Articulation, and Building Facades and Step Backs, as well as LUCE goals and policies.', ' ', 'The project complies with all of the LUCE goals and policies listed by the appellant: ', ' ', '·              LUCE, pg. 2.1-42-(General Commercial):  This appears to be a typo and should read 2.1-39.  The building complies with the maximum allowable height of 36 feet adjacent to the property line along the boulevard or the intersecting side street as measured from the midpoint of Segmented Average Natural Grade (SANG).   ', ' ', '·              LU 1.3 Quality of Life; Goal LU 1:  This goal and land use policy states to preserve neighborhood quality of life and protect neighborhoods against potential impacts related to development, traffic, noise, air quality, and encroachment of commercial activities and establish standards that transition down the building envelope of commercial buildings adjacent to residential properties. The proposed building and project site complies with all Tier 2 development standards as outlines in SMMC Section 9.11.030.  Additionally, it will also have to comply with all conditions of approval, which address traffic, noise and air quality.  Lastly, the building envelope complies with the Daylight Plane Adjacent to Residential Districts (SMMC Section 9.11.030(D)). ', ' ', '·              LU 1.5 Design Compatibility; Goal LU1:  This goal requires that all new infill development be compatible with existing scale, mass and character of the residential neighborhood. New buildings should transition in size, height, and scale toward adjacent residential structures. As stated previously, the project has imposed conditions of approval for the ARB to review (Condition #1) in that it requires the applicant to revise the size, massing and placement of the proposed structure as well as determining whether the proposed siting and design is compatible to the surrounding area. ', ' ', '·              LU 15.8 Building Articulation and LU 15.11 Building Façades and Step Backs:  The buildings articulation and façades provide additional setbacks and stepbacks on the upper floors and provides a 5 foot average on the street facing façade on Lincoln consistent with SMMC 9.11.030.  Further, any other articulation required will be reviewed by the ARB as well as ensuring that highly reflective materials will be avoided and that the building massing and design as viewed form the public sidewalks and roadways will allow enough light, air and sense of openness along all facades.    ', ' ', 'Further, staff has identified additional LUCE goals and policies, specifically, Goal B25 (Lincoln Boulevard Goals and Policies) seeks redevelopment of Lincoln Boulevard as a district and visually-cohesive mixed-use commercial boulevard.  In addition, Policy B25.5 encourages a lively streetscape with places for people to socialize, where gathering spaces and plazas are encouraged and Policy B25.9 encourages that new mixed-use buildings adjacent to residential districts are contained within a prescribed building envelope that steps down toward the residential district to maintain access to light and air.  The project is consistent with Policy B25.10, which seeks to limit ground floor uses to mostly active retail with generally continuous, transparent (non-tinted) display windows facing the sidewalks and Policy B25.11 which encourages mixed-use projects to have active ground floor uses that face the boulevard with residential uses located on the upper floors.  ', '3.              Compliance with the Zoning Ordinance', 'A.                 The appellant states, “Setbacks are inaccurately defined in the staff report: Page 24 states “No (required) interior side yard setback.” The appellant references Section 9.11.030 Development Standards, Height limit 32’ (36’ if on-site affordable housing provided); Minimum Interior Side and Rear-Adjacent to Residential District, 10’.”', ' ', 'The Planning Commission staff report erroneously stated that no interior setback is required.  Notwithstanding this typographical error, the project was fully reviewed and found to be compliant with all applicable Zoning Ordinance development standards.  The project provides a 10’ setback at both the interior side and rear yards.  Further, the building height does not exceed 36’ as measured from SANG. ', ' ', 'B.                 The appellant states, “The maximum height for Tier 2 projects in the GC zone is clear: 36 feet. There is not a special condition allowing building on sloped lots to exceed that height through creative grade calculations. The staff report refers to the project as a 36-foot four story building (pg.1) a five story building (pgs.28 and 30) and a 3 story building (pg.1 CEQA Exemption checklist).  Front to rear yard is shown in the staff report using the segmented average natural grade calculation.  The side yard grade is steep, yet there is no indication of the side yard slope formulation to prove its inapplicability.  Additionally, the sites steep east/west grade is possibly compromised due to the adjacent 10 unit CIM Group project under construction which is virtually unmentioned in the staff report. Lastly, the actual height of the building at the corner of Ashland and Lincoln is 45’-8” (as stated by the applicant upon questioned by the Planning Commission) which is not mentioned in the text body of the staff report. However, pages 1, 8, 12, 16, 20, 23, 24 and 28 refer to (either/both) a 4-story building with a maximum height of 36 feet.  There is one instance where the building is referred to as approximately 36 feet.”  The appellant references Section 9.04.050(B)(2) Measuring Building Height on Sloped Parcels, Sloped Parcels, Side to Side.', ' ', 'The reference to a five-story building in the Planning Commission STOA was a typographical error.  Staff has revised the STOA accordingly to reflect the project as a 36-feet, four story building.  Further, staff determined the building height to be in compliance utilizing the SANG height methodology (SMMC 9.04.050 (A)(2)). SANG is measured from the elevation levels of three equal segments between the front setback line and rear setback line. As shown in Figure 3, the three equal segments shall be created by drawing imaginary lines connecting opposite side setback lines (or parcel lines if no setbacks are required) at 1/3 increments of the depth of the parcel from the front setback line to the rear setback line (or parcel lines if no setbacks are required). The elevation for the front 1/3 segment shall be equal to the elevation of the midpoint of the front setback line (or parcel line if no setback is required). The elevation for the rear 1/3 segment shall be equal to the elevation of the midpoint of the rear setback line (or parcel line if no setback is required). The elevation of the middle 1/3 segment shall equal the halfway elevation between the front and rear 1/3 segments.  ', 'Figure 3: Segmented Average Natural Grade Height Methodology', 'On sheet A1 of the project plans (Attachment C), the SANG diagrams are provided to show compliance with the determined building height methodology.  All elevation points used are derived from the survey prepared on February 14, 2016, prior to the adjacent 10-unit project commencing construction in September of 2016.  The height of the building (45’-8”) stated by the appellant is measured from finished ground floor elevation.  However, pursuant to the SANG height measurement methodology in the Zoning Ordinance, building height is measured from the mid-point front yard elevation, which is fully compliant at a height of 36 feet.  ', ' ', 'C.                The appellant references Section 9.11.010(D) Purpose. Establish design standards that improve the visual quality of development and create a unified, distinctive, and attractive character along commercial and mixed-use corridors.  The appellant states, “This is subjective and therefore a legally vulnerable directive under HAA. The city will lose control of "look" without more specificity in the code if they continue to set HAA ahead of our General Plan and Zoning Ordinance in the review process. Based on the majority of responses of the public and the Planning Commissioners at the hearing on January 10th, 2018, and also members of the ARB at the "float-up", this project doesn\'t meet the bar due to mass, density, and design relevance to the surrounding neighborhoods (even bordering R1), as well as increasing traffic through the neighborhood.”', ' ', 'The appellant is referencing one of the purposes of the Mixed-Use and Commercial Districts in the zoning ordinance.  The City is required by state law to comply with the provisions of the HAA.  In accordance with recently adopted state legislation, which became effective on January 1, 2018, a local agency’s failure to comply with the HAA may result in civil penalties in the minimum amount of $10,000 per housing unit in the development project (multiplied by a factor with potentially higher penalties for “bad faith” determinations). The recent changes to state law also modified the judicial standard of review to be less deferential to local agency determinations as well as expedited judicial review.  Notwithstanding these recent changes to the HAA, the HAA does not define or set the standards for development and therefore, does not impose any independent development standards that would supersede the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance and the LUCE.  Any new housing development project must still comply with all City standards and criteria as established by the City’s Municipal Code and the LUCE.  The project complies with all applicable development standards in the zoning ordinance and meets the required Development Review Permit findings.  Particular design concerns have been included as conditions for the ARB to review as part of its formal design review of the project.  ', ' ', 'D.                The appellant references Section 9.11.030(E) Purpose. Provide appropriate buffers and transition standards between commercial and residential uses to preserve both commercial and mixed-use feasibility and residential quality and provide a sensitive transition between the commercial uses and neighboring residences. The appellant states, “Despite the minimal setbacks imposed on the project, the applicant and planning staff feel comfortable placing a large transformer (a rear yard use) on Wilson Place in what should be the buffering setback to an R1 district where all other uses on that street are beautiful street frontage of single family residences. While this has been constructed by planning staff to be the "rear yard" of the site, its effect is as a side yard. This placement conflicts with the intention of...Item #24 in Conditions of Approval (pg. 38 of the Staff Report) under Final Design: No gas or electric meters shall be located within the required front or street side yard setback areas. This project fails lot size (lot depth) conformity standards if the front yard were Lincoln. However, the Staff report refers to the Lincoln "side yard" as frontage. Can this project have a front yard on Ashland, but a Lincoln address and driveway access? Making Wilson Place the "rear yard" isn\'t consistent with how the rest of that street is developed. Planning staff "cherry picks" the code to advantage the developer, and to the detriment of the surrounding R1 and R2 neighborhoods and streets.”', ' ', 'Pursuant to SMMC Section 9.04.110, the project site is defined as a corner lot.  As a result, the narrowest dimension of the parcel with street front is considered the front, which is Ashland Avenue.  The rear is opposite the front (Wilson Place) and the remainder of the parcel lines are considered sides (Lincoln Boulevard and interior side).  Due to the site’s configuration and placement along Lincoln Boulevard, the defined front yard is Ashland, street side yard is Lincoln and rear yard is Wilson Place.  This is consistent with the prevailing streetscape along Ashland and Wilson where either front yards or rear yards of neighboring properties are located.  The address of the property is not relevant in determining the front of a parcel.  ', ' ', 'The placement of the proposed transformer is within the required rear yard setback which is permitted by Code. The transformer pad will be screened by a masonry wall and also be landscaped to provide additional buffering subject to the review and approval of the ARB. Further, per Condition #24, there are no utility meters proposed in either the front or street side yard setback areas.  ', ' ', 'E.                 The appellant references Section 9.40.010 (A and D) Purpose: A Development Review Permit is intended to allow the construction of certain projects for which the design and siting could result in an adverse impact on the surrounding area. The permit allows for: A) Review of the location, size, massing, and placement of the proposed structure on the site; D) A determination of whether the proposed siting and design should be permitted by weighing the public need for the benefit to be derived from the proposed site plan use against the impact which it may cause.  The appellant states, “Again, the original Staff Report suggested topics and design strategies for discussion; the Supplemental Staff Report effectively annihilated that option.”', ' ', 'The Supplemental Staff Report was provided for clarification/informational purposes and to explain the applicability of the Housing Accountability Act.  It did not change any of the analysis of the Development Review Permit in the original staff report, background on design comments, and the staff recommendation. Before voting to approve the project, the Commission held a public hearing including opportunity for public testimony and deliberations on the project.  All of the information presented in the original and supplemental staff report was considered.  In its approval of the project, the Planning Commission included project specific conditions (Condition #1) for the ARB to pay particular attention in its review of the project.  These conditions addressed both SMMC Sections 9.40.010(A) and (D) in that it requires the applicant to revise the design of the proposed structure for additional variation, pedestrian orientation, and materiality.  The ARB has purview to review the design of the project, including the areas highlighted by the Commission’s design conditions.  ', '3.              Application of the Housing Accountability Act (HAA)', 'A.                 Appellant states that the HAA should not have been applied to this project and that application of the HAA dissuaded consideration of public comment.', 'The HAA is a state law, applicable to charter cities, that precludes the Planning Commission or Council from denying, reducing the density of, or making infeasible any housing development project that complies with objective general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards and criteria (collectively, “Objective Standards”) in effect at the time that the project application is deemed complete unless specific findings of adverse impact are made.  Amendments to the HAA, effective January 1, 2018, significantly increased the burden of proof for local agencies to disapprove housing projects or approve projects at lower densities and added civil penalties and other punitive measures to ensure compliance with the HAA. ', ' ', 'As explained in the body of the Planning Commission staff report for 16ENT-0034 (Attachment D), staff has recommended approval of the Project based upon its determination that the Project is consistent with objective zoning and General Plan standards, subject to the applicant\'s compliance with all conditions in the City Council Statement of Official Action ("STOA"), which is attached to the staff report (Attachment A).  The Planning Commission approved the project because no oral or written evidence was presented at the public hearing identifying “specific, adverse impacts” as defined in the HAA.  ', ' ', 'Appellant states that the Planning Commission should have determined whether the project met the criteria for a Development Review Permit before applying the provisions of the HAA.  In accordance with the most recent HAA amendments, however, “a housing development project . . . shall be deemed consistent, compliant, and in conformity with an applicable plan, policy, ordinance, standard, requirement, or other similar provision if there is substantial evidence that would allow a reasonable person to conclude that the housing development project is consistent, compliant, or in conformity.” [Government Code Section 65589.5(f)(4)]  Staff’s determination is that this Tier 2 Project is consistent with “Objective Standards” as defined by the HAA. ', ' ', 'As discussed above, Council may approve this project pursuant to the staff recommendation by making the affirmative findings set forth in the STOA without consideration of the HAA.  Should Council choose to deny or reduce density of this project, findings of “specific, adverse impacts” as set forth in the HAA would be required.   ', ' ', '5.                            Compliance with California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)', ' ', 'A.                 Appellant states that streamlining CEQA conditions for housing amplifies the detrimental effects of traffic; that the CEQA exemption criteria set forth in Section 21155.1 were not met; that the Planning Commission did not conduct a public hearing regarding the CEQA exemption as required by Section 21155.1; and that the draft EIR for the LUCE should have been consulted before an exemption was claimed. ', ' ', 'CEQA and its streamlining provisions established in Public Resources Code (PRC) 21155.1 were enacted by the State Legislature (specifically SB 375 effective January 1, 2009). As a lead agency, the City must review discretionary projects in compliance with the regulatory provisions of CEQA. The full text of PRC 21155.1 is attached (Attachment F).', ' ', 'On January 10, 2018, the Planning Commission held a public hearing to consider approval of the project and determined that the Project met the applicable requirements of PRC 21155.1 and is considered a project to be statutorily exempt from CEQA. Public input given at the public hearing was considered by the Planning Commission in their decision-making.', ' ', 'The Project meets the applicable requirements of a Transit Priority Project under PRC 21155.1 and is considered a project to be statutorily exempt from CEQA. No EIR, either project-level or program level, is required.  CEQA Guidelines Section 15168 establishes the guidelines for when a Program EIR is being prepared for a project and for when a subsequent project may rely on the use of a Program EIR for CEQA compliance. CEQA Guidelines Section 15168 does not apply to the 2903 Lincoln Boulevard Project since a Program EIR is not required for the project - nor is a Program EIR being relied on for CEQA compliance. ', ' ', '6.              Traffic Impacts', ' ', 'A.              Appellant states that traffic impacts of the project should have been further studied pursuant to CEQA and in conjunction with the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan (LiNC).   ', ' ', 'As detailed in the CEQA Exemption Checklist prepared for the project, the Project meets the applicable requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21155.1 and is considered a Transit Priority Project to be statutorily exempt from CEQA.  Unlike categorical exemptions the statutory exemption for a transit priority project is absolute.  A statutory exemption applies to any given project that falls under its definition. Therefore, since the 2903 Lincoln Blvd Project qualifies for a statutory exemption, a traffic study is not required.  Further, the appellant raises concerns regarding existing traffic conditions, which have not been created by the proposed project.  Based on staff’s review of existing conditions that were raised early in the project review process, the project’s circulation design was substantially revised to minimize potential impacts to Ashland Avenue.  ', ' ', 'Regarding existing conditions, the City is currently undertaking efforts to address existing traffic conditions through the Sunset Park Neighborhood Traffic Management Program. Several options are being studied as part of this program but generally, any Sunset Park street that is not signalized and intersects with Lincoln will be evaluated to possible changes to restrict either commute period flows or permanent directional (one-way) closures.', ' ', 'Staff was aware of the potential traffic impacts on Lincoln and ensured the project plans were fully reviewed for compliance with the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan (LiNC).  At the Planning Commission public hearing, staff further discussed and clarified to the Planning Commission how the proposed LiNC plans will coordinate with the project and discussed potential ramifications for circulation and ingress/egress to the site.  The applicant is fully aware of the existing conditions, including the peak hour bus lanes, and will have to accommodate for these conditions as well as planned future improvements adjacent to the project site.  It was presented at the meeting that the planned medians in the LiNC plan will limit (or restrict) the ability for southbound drivers to turn east across Lincoln into the project site.  Instead, southbound drivers will be able to U-turn at Marine in order to access the project.  Northbound drivers exiting the project wanting to go southbound will be able to U-turn at Ashland or further north, if necessary.  Staff is also aware of the existing conditions on both Ashland Avenue and Wilson Place.  Ashland has parking on both sides of the street with the streetscape interrupted by multiple driveways.  Wilson has restricted access from Lincoln with only northbound right turns permitted from Wilson Place.  Due to the number of curb cuts already existing on Ashland Avenue and concerns regarding existing traffic conditions voiced by residents, it was determined that the proposed site access from Lincoln Boulevard would help off-load traffic and minimize the project’s impacts on Ashland Avenue. ', '7.                            Construction Impacts ', ' ', 'A.              Appellant states that construction impacts of the project should have been studied further.', ' ', 'The project will be required to submit a construction mitigation plan in accordance with Condition #88 of the City Council STOA (Attachment A).  As part of this plan the applicant will be required to indicate the location of staging of equipment, anticipated truck routes, number of trucks, and a construction period parking plan, which shall not be permitted to use public streets. The approved mitigation plan shall be posted on the site for the duration of the project construction and shall be produced upon request. This plan has not yet been submitted since it is required prior the issuance of a building permit.  ', ' ', 'As stated prior, the 2903 Lincoln Boulevard Project meets the applicable requirements of PRC 21155.1 and is considered a project to be statutorily exempt from CEQA. Statutory exemptions are projects specifically excluded from CEQA consideration as defined by the State Legislature.  Therefore, no traffic study was required.  ', '8.              Concerns About CIM Group', 'A.                 The appellant states that the project should not have been approved because Planning Director David Martin was Vice President of the CIM Group from 1999 to 2009. ', ' ', 'Planning Director David Martin has not worked for or received income from CIM Group since he left the company in 2009 and therefore does not have financial interest in CIM Group.

They do not follow the rules, and they disrespect neighbors.', 'The City takes seriously all complaints about rule violations.  Concerns about construction at another site, however, are not properly the subject of this appeal but rather should be referred by concerned community members to the City’s Building and Safety Division, which handles all on-going construction projects for compliance with construction rules and regulations.

Council heard from the public and various stakeholders within the City, and directed staff to return to Council with modifications to the recommended pricing strategy that, in the short term, take into account input from Council and the community, and in the long-term, strategically address the reduction of subsidized parking by providing increased investments in diverse mobility options.', ' ', 'Background', 'On May 11, 2010, Council adopted a resolution (Attachment C) establishing new parking rates for off-street parking as a first phase in implementing the 2009 Walker Parking Study recommendations. The Walker Parking Study found that there was an imbalance in pricing between the different parking facilities within Downtown resulting in the unintended consequence of putting visitors, employees, and transient and monthly parkers in competition for the most convenient and often least expensive spaces while other spaces in the City remained largely unoccupied. Walker Parking consultants provided recommendations consistent with the LUCE to better manage parking demand and maximize efficiency of the public parking supply in Downtown Santa Monica. ', ' ', 'On July 10, 2012, Council adopted a resolution (Attachment D) establishing new parking fees at citywide on-street parking meters, off-street parking facilities, and beach parking lots, including a reduction in the Downtown free parking “grace” period from two hours to 90 minutes. These changes were informed by a parking rate study conducted by Walker Parking Consultants in 2012, consistent with the LUCE and the 2009 Walker Parking Study. ', ' ', 'On May 10, 2016, Council adopted a resolution (Attachment E) establishing revised parking rates for the Civic Center and Downtown parking facilities to address increased high weekday occupancies and discourage potential “park and ride” activity due to the arrival of the Expo Light Rail. ', ' ', 'Discussion', 'On March 6, 2018, staff conducted a study session (Attachment F) with City Council that included various demand-responsive parking pricing strategy options for Council consideration. Staff sought Council direction on the concept of implementing a demand-responsive parking pricing strategy that sets different parking rate structures on weekdays and weekends based on their different demand patterns. The proposed parking strategies were based on a detailed analysis of parking transactions and occupancies in each Downtown parking facility, and were designed to:', '·         Facilitate at least 15% parking availability in all facilities at all times', '·         Redirect long-term parking sessions to less expensive parking facilities outside of the Downtown core', '·         Maximize the use of existing public parking inventory', '·         Address occupancy, traffic, access and circulation challenges', '·         Encourage consideration of travel mode shift', '·         Reduce subsidized parking for monthly permit holders  ', 'Prior to developing the parking pricing strategies for Council consideration, staff conducted study sessions with various stakeholders throughout the City to ensure that the needs of the communities represented by the respective stakeholders were considered and included in the overall proposal to Council. During this thorough six month outreach process, staff received verbal and written comments from residents and stakeholders in the City that supported staff’s overall proposal to address traffic congestion and excessively high parking facility peak occupancies. However, the feedback on how to address these challenges varied amongst stakeholders. For example, there was unequivocal support from Santa Monica Travel and Tourism, which promotes the City of Santa Monica as a travel destination as well as local employment opportunities in the City, on all of the staff proposed pricing strategies (Attachment G). There were other stakeholders in the City who also supported the overall goals, but recommended addressing the current challenges with varied pricing alternatives, primarily being the preservation of the free parking for the first 90 minutes in the Downtown core parking facilities. Attachment H includes formal written comments from these stakeholders, community members and residents.', ' ', 'In light of the comprehensive discussion and feedback, Council directed staff to return to Council promptly with the necessary ordinance and resolution to adopt the proposed parking rate increases with the following modifications:', ' ', 'Immediate Parking Pricing Strategies', '·         Maintain first 90 minutes free parking period in PS 1-9 and KEC', '·         Increase parking rates; however maintain a uniform parking rate structure across Downtown core facilities, PS 1-8 and KEC, to avoid customer confusion', '·         Eliminate monthly parking in PS 1 and PS 3, providing alternative parking options, if necessary, in PS 9 and PS 10 based on availability', '·         Draft an ordinance that streamlines the process and modernizes the municipal code to reflect the current practice of setting on-street and off-street parking rates based on goals outlined in the LUCE and DCP', '·         Continue subsidizing parking for Ken Edwards Center and Santa Monica Emeritus College program users', '·         Develop new subsidized parking options for Main Library program users', '·         Continue to invest incremental parking revenues over the FY 2009-10 base year into parking traffic, access, and circulation programs, including transit subsidy options', 'Staff recommends that Council adopt the attached resolution that includes the immediate parking pricing strategies as submitted for implementation by July 1, 2018. This proposal addresses the immediate implementation of the necessary ordinance and resolution to establish rates in a timely manner.', ' ', ' ', 'Long-term Parking Management Strategies', 'Staff will work with city stakeholders and other City Departments to develop a long-term comprehensive strategy that is aligned with the City’s larger focus on supporting a more livable community, and return to Council on or before June 30, 2019 with specific long term strategy proposals for Council approval and adoption. Among the steps staff will take going forward are the following:', ' ', '·         Partner with City Departments, stakeholders, and TNC businesses to create mobility options that support the use of more sustainable travel modes', '·         Evaluate the effectiveness of a SM Resident Downtown Access Parking Program and a Downtown Merchant Validation Program', '·         Work with stakeholders to analyze the feasibility of pursuing a universal valet parking program', '·         Return to Council with a comprehensive strategy that addresses the reduction of free or subsidized parking with investments in tangible mobility options', '·         Return to Council annually to report on the State of Citywide Parking', ' ', 'Judicial Council Parking', 'The fee resolution also extends the bulk parking fee for the California Judicial Council for twelve months from July 2018 to June 2019 in anticipation of the multipurpose sports field, with a possible request for a six month extension if construction demands allow.  The Council has made progress in promoting alternative options for its employees, customers, and jurors; however, the Council requires additional time to address budget impacts and to develop programs to address its minimum parking needs, particularly for members of the public who utilize the court’s services.', ' ', 'Financial Impacts and Budget Actions', 'Due to the ever-changing conditions surrounding current and emerging transportation options and parking alternatives, revenue projections in establishing budgets are as much an art as a science, and predictive models developed by staff to gauge parking revenues fall into this category. The model used to develop the proposed pricing strategy is based on the concept of demand elasticity and recognizes that both occupancy and elasticity changes throughout the day, including research that suggests that elasticities tend to be higher when there are more alternative transportation options.', ' ', 'The proposed parking rate and permit fee adjustments account for parkers shifting amongst the Citywide parking facilities, and takes a proactive approach to managing demand across the remaining parking facilities, slightly increasing the Downtown core parking rates to encourage parkers to shift to less expensive facilities without oversaturating any given facility due to significant rate differential between structures. Lessons learned from the FY 2016-17 parking rate change suggest that not making the secondary rate increase to other peripheral parking facilities within the Downtown portfolio would result in potential overcrowding in those facilities. ', ' ', 'Staff believes that the following range between $3 million and $5 million of increased revenues is sound, prudent, and based on an elasticity model that has included several years of data from Santa Monica parking facilities as well as benchmarking against industry standards of practice and in comparison with other parking operations with similar characteristics. While no model will exactly predict total revenues, staff is confident that it has established a fairly strong case for these predicted increases, if the recommendation is approved as submitted for implementation by July 1, 2018. The anticipated revenues would primarily recover the revenues lost over the last 1-2 years due downward trend of parking transactions related to the changing mobility patterns. Staff will include the revenue projections as part of the FY 2018-19 Exception Based Budget, and will continue to actively monitor parking activity in the various facilities and adjust revenue estimates, if necessary, during the FY 2018-19 midyear budget.', ' ']}], 1524326400: [], 1523406600: [{'Title': ' Proclamation declaring April as ArtsMonth 2018.', 'ID': '2926', 'MeetingID': '1138', 'Department': '2: Special Agenda Items', 'Sponsors': None, 'Actions': []}, {'Title': ' City Manager Report: ArtsMonth – An ode to the arts and creativity in Santa Monica', 'ID': '2935', 'MeetingID': '1138', 'Department': '2: Special Agenda Items', 'Sponsors': None, 'Actions': []}, {'Title': ' Recognition of Interim Police Chief Kenneth Semko', 'ID': '2964', 'MeetingID': '1138', 'Department': '2: Special Agenda Items', 'Sponsors': None, 'Actions': []}, {'Title': ' Airport Lease Agreement with Santa Monica Community College District', 'ID': '2300', 'MeetingID': '1138', 'Department': 'Public Works, Airport Division', 'Sponsors': None, 'Actions': ['Staff recommends that the City Council authorize the City Manager to negotiate and execute a lease agreement with Santa Monica Community College District (SMC) for classroom space located at 2800 Airport Avenue, Santa Monica, CA 90405, reflecting the general terms and conditions outlined in this report.'], 'Body': []}, {'Title': ' Award Construction Contract for the Big Blue Bus LCNG Fuel System Modification Project', 'ID': '2652', 'MeetingID': '1138', 'Department': 'Public Works, Architecture Services', 'Sponsors': None, 'Actions': ['1.
