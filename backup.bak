1	Request to Approve Plans to Restore and Rehabilitate the Historic Interior Lobby of the Former United States Post Office Building Located at 1248 5th Street, in Accordance with a Preservation Covenant Administered by the City Council	Design & Preservation (PCD)	The property owner is requesting approval to restore and rehabilitate the historic lobby of the former United States Post Office located at 1248 5 th Street as part of an overall plan to adaptively reuse the Landmark building as a headquarters for Skydance Productions, a film/television production company. The applicant/property owner intends to utilize the historic lobby as both a visitor reception area and a commissary to support on-site employees and guests. Because the lobby is governed by a preservation covenant that is administered by the City Council, permission to make any alterations, including restoration and rehabilitation activities, must be granted by the City Council.  The property owner has retained the services of a preservation architect, Chattel, Incorporated, who has achieved a sensitive design approach that balances corporate prerequisites with historic sensitivity, and provides assurance that the project complies with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. Overall, the scope of work maintains the integrity of the historic lobby and enhances the historic character of the lobby in accordance with the Preservation Covenant and Landmarks Ordinance. 	\N	Staff recommends that the City Council appoint the Landmarks Commission Secretary to act as its designee to approve certain  minor modifications to the historic lobby based on the recommendation of a qualified historic architect. On August 27, 2013, the Council approved a preservation covenant for the former Downtown Post Office building in advance of its sale to a private party.  The preservation covenant, which was attached as a rider to the grant deed, ensures protection of the property’s historic integrity, and that its distinct features and finishes will be retained, including those found in the historic interior lobby space including:  ·  the original hanging light fixtures, ·  marble wainscot, ·  horizontal wood walls and ceilings, ·  metal staircase rails, and ·  tall tables  Please note that further research has since confirmed that the salmon-color marble wainscot is not original to t he building’s construction in 1938.  The original wainscot consisted of four-inch square terra cotta tiles.  A tile believed to be from the original wainscot was found in the janitor’s closet in the southern portion of the building.  The tile was examined by the applicant’s architectural conservator.  It was beige in color, and the material was identified as terra cotta.  On March 10, 2014, the Landmarks Commission designated the former Post Office building and the parcel on which it is situated as a Landmark and Landmark Parcel.   In doing so, the protection of any historic feature included in the designation would be achieved pursuant to the Landmarks Ordinance, specifically through the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness.  However, as the designation did not include any interior portion or elements of the building, the protection of any of these identified features, as specified in the historic covenant, can only be accomplished through Council approval.  A Certificate of Appropriateness is only relevant to those features specifically identified in the Landmark designation.  On October 27, 2015, the City Council approved on its consent calendar a procedural and testing protocol for analyzing material samples and finishes on interior portions of the former United States Post Office building.  The results of this analysis guided the applicant in developing the plans currently under consideration.  On April 20, 2016, the Planning Commission approved a rear building addition to the former Post Office building and an associated parking variance to accommodate its future adaptive reuse as creative office space.  This decision was appealed, and ultimately upheld by the City Council on August 9, 2016.  The City Council decision included a condition of approval that encouraged the applicant to present any proposed alterations to the historic interior lobby to the Landmarks Commission for its  recommendation prior to formal review of the proposed alterations by the City Council.  On September 12, 2016, the Landmarks Commission approved a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed building design, colors, materials, lighting and landscaping for the approved expansion and for rehabilitation of the building’s exterior and grounds.  On November 14, 2016, the Landmarks Commission received a courtesy presentation describing the rehabilitation and restoration activities affecting the historic interior lobby that are necessary in support of the building’s adaptive re-use.  The Landmarks Commission provided its unanimous recommendation in support of the request and encouraged the applicant to celebrate the nuances of the building’s past as a former US Post Office and reveal this history in the lobby design through retention of past repair work. Commissioners also suggested aligning the wood intersections on the ceiling to minimize the stepping and encouraged the use of light wood finishes.  Any new construction should be differentiated through the use of diverse materials. Commissioners raised safety concerns regarding the glass partitions. The historic lobby of the former Post Office building has undergone numerous renovations since the date of its original construction in 1938.  The applicant is proposing a two-prong preservation approach in connection with the applicant’s adaptive reuse of the building’s lobby to accommodate creative office space;  rehabilitation and restoration. ·  Rehabilitation is the act or process of making possible a compatible use for a property through repair, alterations, and additions while preserving those portions or features which convey its historic, cultural, or architectural values. Rehabilitation al lows compatible new construction. Generally speaking, the proposed rehabilitation work includes the removal of non-historic features and materials and the installation of any replacement, and the construction of a new partition walls to separate the reception lobby and commissary spaces. ·  Restoration is the process of accurately depicting the features and character of a property as it appeared at a particular period of time, typically its period of significance.  This is accomplished by removing features from other periods in its history and reconstructing missing features from its period of significance. The restoration activities proposed will return the configuration, materials, and finishes of the terrazzo flooring and wood board cladding to their original appearance. Specific details of the proposed rehabilitation and restoration of the lobby is presented below, specific to general building parameters.  The plans were developed by the applicant’s preservation architect, and represent the recommended treatment t o ensure consistency with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Resources, as required by the Preservation Covenant.  Walls The lobby walls and ceilings are partially clad in sugar pine (a type of white pine)  which would be retained in place. The walls have experience d discoloration and are showing signs of crazing (cracking) and separation. The proposed treatment of the historic wood cladding would include removal of the layers of coating using a chemical application, cleaning of the wood, and application of a new clear coating.  A reddish-brown oil based stain will be applied, matched to the color of the trim . Following the removal of non-historic alterations, any holes would be patched or wood boards would be replaced in-kind, as necessary and where appropriate.  The existing non-historic marble wainscot would be removed and replaced with new natural limestone slabs in a neutral grey color with a honed finish.  This will result in an appearance that would be more consistent with the appearance of the original tile wainscot.  The historic , individual customer service windows along the west wall would be reestablished with an interpretation that would generally utilize historic sizes and pattern based on original drawings and early photographs.  These new windows would be comprised of clear glass with signage panels above and painted surrounds and sills.  For fire safety purposes, the sills and surrounds would be reimagined in steel (as opposed to wood) and painted to match other features of the lobby. Gold leaf lettering would be restored on the signage panels above each service window based on original drawings, and individually would read as Parcel Post, Stamps, General Delivery, Information, and Registry.  A non-historic roll-up metal door and counter at the south wall recess would be removed and infilled with a new wood frame and glazed double-door.  The janitor’s original wood door would be fixed in place.  The original stainless steel handrail would be reinstalled in the same location on this wall, and the decorative stainless steel railing surrounding the stair in this location will also be retained in place.  Ceiling and Lighting The historic wood ceiling would remain in place and would be repaired and treated in the same way as the historic wood walls.  The six historic pendant light fixtures would be re-lamped and restored to original sizes (where previously truncated).  Any canned lighting will be removed.  Terrazzo Flooring The existing terrazzo lobby floors will be retained, repaired, cleaned and treated with an application of a new protective clear coating.  Partitioning The non-historic wood and glass partition wall that separated the customer service area from postal boxes area of the lobby will be removed.  A new wood and glass partition wall will be installed in a new location that aligns with the pilasters directly south of the northern entrance.  This new partition wall will serve to divide the historic lobby into a reception lobby in the northern end from a commissary dining room in the center.  A secondary free standing partition wall would further divide the commissary space in the center from an employee lounge area to the south.  The partitions would include mill work for storage.  Per the recommendation of the Landmarks Commission, the millwork aspect of these partitions would be clad in maple to differentiate the new additions from the historic sugar pine clad walls. Also, the extensive use of glass maintains the spatial relationships and feeling that the lobby is one long rectilinear space.  Desk and Tables The lobby consisted of five original tall maple tables with stainless steel feet and non-original composite tops.  They were originally bolted to the ground. These tables have been identified as historic interior features.  The tables would be retained as movable furniture pieces used within the rehabilitated commissary.  The table’s non-original composite material topping would be replaced with glass, as they were historically. Future Interior Modifications and Alterations The approved preservation covenant for the former Downtown Post Office building was approved by City Council in advance of its sale to a private party.  The preservation covenant, which was attached as a rider to the grant deed, ensures protection of the property’s historic integrity, and that its distinct features and finishes will be retained, as described in the Background section of this report including those found in the historic interior lobby space. Because the lobby is governed by a preservation covenant that is administered by the City Council, permission to make any alterations, including restoration and rehabilitation activities, must be granted by the City Council.  This process could be time consuming to the property owner, particularly when a proposed alteration is minor in nature and will not result in any compromised integrity.  To remedy this , staff recommends that the City Council direct  any  alterations of the historic lobby proposed by the property owner be undertaken with the assistance of a historic architect meeting the Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards in Historic Architecture (36 CFR Part 61, Appendix A). Staff further recommends that the City Council appoint the Landmarks Commission Secr etary to act as its designee to approve any minor modifications  to the historic lobby , such as refinements of approved colors, materials , finishes, lighting, fixtures or partitions ,  provided that the work will not negatively impact any of the identified character-defining features of the lobby and the work will be completed in compliance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties .  The property owner’s historic architect shall affirm this in written correspondence to the Landmarks Commission Secretary prior to any approvals being granted .  Staff further recommends that the City Council retain its review and approval authority on s ignificant changes to the rehabilitation and restoration of the historic lobby , including the removal of any of the identified character-defining features. 	\N	1
2	Study Session on Cannabis Regulations	Planning and Community Development	In 2015, two medical cannabis dispensaries were authorized by the Zoning Ordinance (ZO).   Due to the rapid changes in State law governing cannabis regulations, the City has not accepted applications to operate a medical cannabis dispensary.  Staff recommends that Council direct staff to establish a regulatory permit and selection process with objective criteria for the two dispensaries envisioned by the ZO, in addition to the required Conditional Use Permit (CUP).  Due to current Planning and Community Development priorities and the uncertainties around how recreational marijuana legalization will play out , staff also recommends that Council direct staff to draft an ordinance prohibiting commercial cannabis related business activities and to update the Zoning Ordinance to address changes in State law related to cannabis regulations. The Council could revisit this in the future based on experience in other communities. 	In 1996 California voters passed the California Compassionate Use Act (CUA), which appeared on the ballot as Proposition 215, creating a limited immunity for individuals who used cannabis for medical purposes to use in court if  they get arrested and calling on the legislature to regulate distribution. The legislature cannot change this immunity. In 2003 the State adopted Senate Bill 420, also known as the Medical Marijuana Program Act (MMPA), broadened the CUA to certain transportation related and other offences, provided limited immunity for groups of patients who form  “collectives” or “cooperatives”, and created a voluntary state ID card program to identify qualified patients who register with the program.  Of course, despite the limited California State legalization, marijuana remains a Schedule I Controlled Substance under Federal law.  This means that private possession, use, or distribution of marijuana remains, and continues to remain, illegal for all purposes, including medical purposes. In 2013  the United States Attorney General’s Office issued what is referred to as the “Cole Memo ” that it will not interfere with state laws that include “robustly enforced” “strict regulations”  On June 23, 2015, City Council adopted an update to the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (ZO) which authorized two medical cannabis dispensaries no larger than 2,500 square feet with the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP).  Distancing requirements from certain sensitive uses such as schools and day care facilities were established among other regulations.  The two dispensaries were also limited to the following Mixed-Use and Commercial District locations:  ·  Mixed-Use Boulevard District along Wilshire Boulevard between Lincoln Boulevard and Centinela Avenue; ·  General Commercial District along Santa Monica Boulevard between Lincoln Boulevard and 20th Street; and ·  Mixed-Use Boulevard Low District along Santa Monica Boulevard between 23rd Street and Centinela Avenue.  The ZO defines “Medical Marijuana Dispensary” as: Any facility, building, structure, or fixed location where one or more qualified patients and/or persons with identification cards and/or primary caregivers cultivate, distribute, sell, dispense, transmit, process, exchange, give away, or otherwise make available marijuana for medical purposes. The terms “primary caregiver”, “qualified patient”, and “person with an identification card” shall be as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5 et seq.  Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act In October 2015, the California State Legislature passed and the Governor signed the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MCRSA) which was comprised of three bills (Assembly Bills 243 and 266, and Senate Bill 643).  This Act created for the first time a comprehensive regulatory framework for medical cannabis, including cultivation, distribution, manufacturing, testing, and sale.  The regulation of this full supply chain of activities for cannabis is commonly referred to as “seed to sale” regulations by the industry.  MCRSA is more far reaching than the CUA and MMPA, which merely provided state law immunity to qualified patients and primary caregivers, but did not regulate the cannabis market itself.  MCRSA mandates that state agencies set up extensive rules and systems to regulate and control the cannabis market.  MCRSA establishes the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Control (BMCC) under the Department of Consumer Affairs, which is responsible for administering and enforcing MCRSA, including the writing of rules that will govern the medical cannabis marketplace.  MCRSA grants licensing authority to the Department of Food and Agriculture and the Department of Public Health.  It ends the current collective/cooperative model by sunsetting SB 420 one year after the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Control posts a notice on its website that licenses are being issued.  After that date, all medical cannabis collectives will have to be licensed.  The League of California Cities’ Medical Marijuana – Revisited After New State Laws , which was delivered on May 4, 2016 at the League’s City Attorney Spring Conference is provided as Attachment A.  Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA) / Proposition 64 On November 8, 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, with 57.13% of voters supporting the initiative.  Within Los Angeles County 59.54% supported the initiative, and in Santa Monica, the initiative was supported by 71% of voters.  The AUMA took effect November 9, 2016, immediately following the election.  Under AUMA a person 21 years of age or older may now possess, process, transport, purchase or give away (to persons 21 years of age or older) not more than 28.5 grams  of cannabis in the non-concentrated form and not more than 8 grams of cannabis in a concentrated form including cannabis products like edibles and extracts.   Smoking is allowed in a private home or at a business licensed for on-site cannabis consumption, and also allows legal possession of cannabis accessories.  AUMA does not allow for commercial sales without both a state and local permit, and clearly provides that local jurisdictions continue to have full authority to regulate or prohibit any business establishment selling recreational cannabis.  Although AUMA authorizes adults in California to legally possess, use, and transport recreational cannabis, there is currently no legal business in the state to purchase recreational cannabis, since licensed medical dispensaries are not allowed to sell recreational cannabis (i.e. to persons who do not have the required physician’s recommendation to purchase medical cannabis). Though out-of-state residents can legally purchase recreational cannabis under AUMA, they too may not do so until state and local licensing begins, as currently licensed medical dispensaries may only dispense medical cannabis to California residents for medical use.  At this point in time a person may use it, give it, and grow it; but they may not sell it.  Under AUMA, a person may not: ·  Consume cannabis in a business establishment unlicensed for such use; ·  Smoke cannabis anywhere smoking tobacco is prohibited; ·  Smoke cannabis within 1,000 feet of a school, day care, or youth center while children are present (except in a private residence); ·  Possess cannabis on the grounds of a school, day care center, or youth center while children are present; ·  Possess an open container while driving or riding in a car, boat, or other vehicle; or ·  Consume cannabis while driving or riding in a vehicle (except where local ordinances allow it).  AUMA provides that local jurisdictions may impose additional "reasonable regulations"  on personal cultivation outdoors.  Under AUMA, however,  local jurisdictions may not prohibit indoor personal grows of up to 6 plants in a private residence or inside an "accessory structure" on the grounds of a private residence that is "fully enclosed and secure."   AUMA’s stated purpose and intent is to “take nonmedical cannabis production and sales out of the hands of the illegal market and bring them under a regulatory structure that prevents access by minors and protects public safety, public health, and the environment”, and control cultivation, processing, manufacture, distribution, testing and sale of nonmedical cannabis…” including requiring state agencies to establish a program that is nearly identical to MCRSA.  The League of California Cities issued a memorandum dated September 26, 2016, titled The Control, Regulate, and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act (Attachment B).   It is important to note that the document was issued prior to the passage of AUMA by the voters.  The League of California Cities also published a document on frequently asked questions regarding AUMA which was issued on November 16, 2016, after the initiative was passed by the voters (Attachment C).  Key Licensing Provisions of Cannabis Regulations under AUMA and MCRSA Both MCRSA and AUMA establish six nearly identical license categories.  Some of the differences include:   ·  Under MCRSA the retail sales permit is called “Dispensary” and under AUMA it is called “Retailer”; ·  AUMA did not create a separate “Transporting” permit as MCRSA does, instead this activity is covered under the “Distribution” license; ·  MCRSA contains a “Specialty Cottage” cultivation license to accommodate “micro farmers”. ·  AUMA created a category of cannabis businesses called “microbusinesses” which is not included under MCRSA.  A “microbusiness” is defined as a small operator with cultivation space not exceeding 10,000 square feet.  A microbusiness license would allow holders to cultivate cannabis and act as a licensed distributor, Level 1 manufacture (using either nonvolatile solvents or no solvents), and retailer all under one license.  Following are the license categories that currently exist: 	     Cultivation 1-4 Cultivation 1-5 Manufacturing 6-7 Manufacturing 6-7 Testing 8 Testing 8 Dispensary 10 Retailer 10 Distribution 11 Distribution 11 Transporting 12 N/A N/A Microbusiness 12  Within the categories, MCRSA established a total of 17 license types and AUMA established a total of 19 license types.  Attachment D provides a detailed comparison of the various licenses.  Both medical and recreational cannabis business activities will require permitting and licensing by both the relevant state authorities and the local jurisdiction.     Taxes MCRSA did not create any new taxes for cannabis businesses, however the tax scheme created by AUMA will apply to medical cannabis in addition to recreational cannabis. All businesses (for - profit and nonprofit) operating pursuant to MCRSA are required to have a seller’s permit with the State Board of Equalization.  The following graph provides an outline of the taxes under both MCRSA and AUMA.   Tax  Medical Cannabis (Licensed under MCRSA)  Recreational Cannabis (Licensed under AUMA) Sales and Use Tax * Effective November 9, 2016 Exempt 10.5% (Santa Monica) Effective January 1, 2018  15% Excise tax on gross receipts for both medical and recreational cannabis. The excise tax would be imposed on purchasers of cannabis or cannabis products sold in California. Effective January 1, 2018  Tax on all harvested medical and recreational cannabis that enters the commercial market.  Tax does not apply to cannabis cultivated for personal use or cultivated by a qualified patient or primary caregiver. Tax is calculated as follows: ·  Cannabis flowers: $9.25 per dry-weight ounce ·  Cannabis leaves: $2.75 per dry-weight ounce  *AUMA requires that a study be conducted by January 1, 2018, to determine whether nonprofit recreational cannabis businesses should also be exempt from the state taxes and fees.  Any cannabis b usinesses operating within Santa Monica would also be subject to all Business License requirements outlined in Article 6 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code.  As such, a for - profit cannabis retailer, whether for medical or commercial uses, would be classified as Tax Rate Group 1 Retail business under Section 6.08.140 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code and would therefore be required to pay $1.25 for each $1,000 or fraction thereof of gross receipts in excess of $60,000 in addition to a $75 minimum tax on receipts up to $60,000.  For example, a business that report $1,000,000 in gross receipts for the tax year would be required to pay $1,255 in business license tax.  Local governments can impose additional taxes on cannabis businesses, however, imposing any new taxes would require voter approval.  The State also adopted several other bills to augment MCRSA and AUMA and new legislation has been introduced that is currently pending in the legislature. (Attachment E). For the purpose of this report the term cannabis is used interchangeably with marijuana.  It is also intended to mean cannabis in raw plant form (i.e. flower, bud) and processed forms (e.g. edibles, beverages, extracts, topicals, etc.).  The laws regarding cannabis are complicated and conflicting.  Laws differ dramatically from state to state, between states and the federal government, and between the MCRSA and AUMA within California.  Most importantly, cannabis remains illegal under federal law. Recently, federal officials have made statements to indicate that they may view state authorized medical marijuana use differently than recreational marijuana use for enforcement purposes.   As of November 9, 2016, the use of both recreational and medical cannabis has been entirely legalized in Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.  The District of Columbia has also fully legalized recreational and medical cannabis, but the sale of cannabis for recreational use is currently blocked by Congress.  For the remaining states, laws vary widely with some states only legalizing the non-psychoactive form of cannabis (i.e. CBD).  Medical cannabis has been distributed in a “retail” setting through dispensaries in California since the voters adopted the Compassionate Use Act (i.e. Proposition 215) in 1996.  A person must demonstrate that they have a physician recommendation to use cannabis due to a medical condition.  The Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) is currently in the process of establishing the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation ( bmcr.ca.gov ) which will regulate various aspects of the cannabis market for both medical and recreational cannabis businesses, including cultivation, transporting, distribution, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, testing, and retail sales.  The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) has begun establishing the Medical Cannabis Cultivation Program (MCCP) to develop regulations for cultivation.  The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has begun establishing the Office of Manufactured Cannabis Safety (OMCS) but has not produced any publications to date.  The following chart provides a high level summary of the administrative structure for establishing the regulatory scheme:  ·  Distributors ·  Dispensaries ·  Transporters ·  Cultivation ·  Track and Trace ·  Manufacturing ·  Testing   State agencies are also currently establishing rules to govern the market which means the state of cannabis regulations for both medical and recreational businesses are far from settled and will likely continue to develop for the next several years.  Enforcement Challenges and Compliance Regardless of the action taken by Council on recreational cannabis related business activities within Santa Monica, enforcement and regulatory staff will still need to be prepared for the unfolding impacts of legalization statewide.  The legalization of cannabis has brought increased challenges and costs for law enforcement. Particularly since Los Angeles borders Santa Monica, cannabis related tourism will also likely grow.  In preparation for this study session, staff attended the 2016 Marijuana Management Symposium, a gathering of regulators, law enforcement personnel, elected officials, public health officials, and tourism staff.  Denver has seen a decrease in arrests but an increase in demands on police.  The most common cannabis industry related crime in Denver is burglary, accounting for 63% of cannabis industry related crime in 2015.  Law enforcement representatives at the symposium emphasize a need to provide adequate and appropriate staffing for administration, inspections, and enforcement.  For example, training of law enforcement personnel around issues related to driving while under the influence (THC or THC-Combination w/Alcohol); no reliable THC field-testing for sobriety exists currently as with alcohol .  Law enforcement representatives at the symposium also encouraged cities to obtain clear guidance from policy makers on the prioritization of enforcement.  The Police Foundation and the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police issued Colorado’s Legalization of Marijuana and the Impact on Public Safety: A Practical Guide for Law Enforcemen t, which is provided as Attachment F.  If Council directs staff to move forward with the selection of the two medical dispensaries and due to the legalization of cannabis statewide, it will be critical for the City to establish:  ·  Procedures for monitoring compliance for any Medical Cannabis dispensaries that are approved to operate in Santa Monica; ·  Training programs for police officers and other enforcement staff; ·  Enforcement priorities  Additional staffing may be required to ensure that the cannabis program compliance and education programs in Santa Monica are being addressed.  Staff will make any necessary proposals for staffing or resources related to regulating the two medical cannabis dispensaries with any future staff report that may be submitted to create a regulatory permit and selection process.  The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado – The Impact (Volume 4) , published in September 2016 by the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, Investigative Intelligence Unit is also provided as Attachment G for additional information.  Licensing Options The Zoning Ordinance currently requires that a medical cannabis dispensary obtain a Conditional Use Permit.  The following chart outlines several options to regulate and permit cannabis dispensaries. Conditional Use Permit (CUP) only Existing  local law currently requires a Medical Cannabis Dispensary to obtain a CUP.  CUP is approved by the Planning Commission. A CUP may be appealed to or by City Council.   A CUP runs with the land, and does not allow for a vetting process to select each successive business operator.  It only allows the City to grant or deny the CUP as a land use entitlement to the property based on objective factors .  Would only allow for either a “first come, first served” or lottery selection process. Conditional Use Permit w/Regulatory Permit   Existing local law currently requires a Medical Cannabis Dispensary to obtain a CUP.  CUP is approved by the Planning Commission. A CUP may be appealed to or by City Council.  A regulatory permit is approved by City Staff and appealable to a Hearing Examiner. In addition to the CUPs discretionary entitlement process, a regulatory permit would allow the City to vet and approve each successive operator based on objective factors.  The City could create a selection process or rely on a “first come, first served” or lottery system process.  A regulatory permit provides staff with effective means for enforcement of regulatory requirements. 	\N	1
3	Introduction and First Reading of an Ordinance Amending Chapter 4.12 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code Regarding Noise Regulations	Planning and Community Development	At its April 12, 2016 meeting, Council directed staff to return with an amendment to the noise ordinance to exempt from the City’s noise ordinance non-commercial free speech activities within commercial zones between 7:00 am and 10:00 p.m., with a provision to exclude activities that create excessive noise at a permanent residence, hospital, or school.  Staff recommends the creation of a new exemption to the Noise Ordinance in response to Council’s direction. 	At its April 12, 2016 meeting a staff administrative item was presented to Council with background information and a recommendation regarding the Noise Ordinance.  The staff report with attachments from this meeting is included with this report as Attachment A and provides greater background information on prior Council actions.  At this meeting, Council directed staff to return with an amendment to the noise ordinance to include language that non-commercial free speech in a commercial zone, not already covered by specific laws such as those controlling the promenade and pier, that does not create excessive noise at a permanent residence or a hospital or a school, and that occurs between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., be presumed to be a legal activity.  Noise violations are currently enforced by both the City’s Police Department and the Code Enforcement Division.  Sworn police officers take the lead with events or complaints related to larger gatherings and after-hours complaints.  Code Enforcement staff address primarily construction-related noise complaints. 	 The City’s Noise Ordinance (Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 4.12) currently exempts the following activities to varying degrees:   The only limitation the Noise Ordinance currently places upon free-speech activities conducted on outdoor public property resides in SMMC Section 4.12.025, which generally prohibits noise that would “unreasonably disturb the peace, quiet and comfort of persons of normal sensitivity” and noise that is “so harsh or prolonged or unnatural or unusual in [its] use, time or place as to cause physical discomfort to any persons of normal sensitivity….”  Such general prohibitions have been adopted in other cities and upheld by the courts.    Of course, in addition to local law, state law, such as California Penal Code Section 415, also regulates noise on public (and private) properties.  Given Council’s direction to enhance First Amendment protections, staff proposes to add an additional exemption by amending the Noise Ordinance (see Attachment B) to exempt any non-commercial activity on outdoor public property that occurs between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., not including the Santa Monica Pier and Third Street Promenade that does not immediately abut any exclusively residential use.  The exemption would not apply when the non-commercial free speech creates excessive noise at a nearby permanent residence, hospital, or school.  This language is intended to account for the fact that residential property can be constructed in virtually any land use zone within the city and many commercial areas already include mixed uses.  Additionally, regardless of local law, Police officers would still enforce state law’s noise regulations, including California Penal Code Section 415’s prohibition against “disturbing the peace”.  California Penal Code Section 415 prohibits:  1.  Unlawfully fighting, or challenging another person to fight, in a public space, 2.  Disturbing another person by loud and unreasonable noise; if this is done willfully and maliciously, and 3.  Using offensive words in a public place, if the words are likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction.  In conducting community outreach on the proposed change , Unite Here, whose union organizing tactics and police response to them has generated past controversy, has expressed support for the recommended option.  On the other hand, reaction from the Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Santa Monica Inc. was critical of the approach.  Members expressed concern about potential unintended consequences.  Similar concerns have surfaced from some activist members of neighborhood associations concerned about potential spillover impacts on residential areas adjacent to commercial strips although the recommended option is tailored specifically to allay that concern. Council could make no changes to the existing noise ordinance, since existing law would likely withstand a constitutional challenge and provides enforcement staff with the tools necessary to enforce noise related violations. 	\N	1
4	Annual Development Agreement Compliance Review	Design & Preservation (PCD)	This report provides an annual summary of the status of compliance for each of the Development Agreements that are currently in effect and subject to annual compliance report submittals. Council last reviewed the status of Development Agreement compliance at its January 26, 2016 meeting. This year’s summary includes review of all 20 completed projects, six projects that are under construction, and the status of the remaining six Agreements where construction has not commenced.  Attachment A provides the summary discussion for each of these 32 properties and Attachments B and C to this staff report provide a summary of the Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Program requirements that have been required for new and amended Development Agreements since 2010.  Based on staff’s review of each of the 20 projects already built and the annual reports submitted by the developers or successors-in-interest to demonstrate good faith compliance, staff recommends Council determine that 19 of these Agreements are in good faith compliance with requirements specified for each property and one of these Agreements is not. This report provides information regarding steps for enforcement for one completed project, Agensys, where good faith compliance with its Average Vehicle Ridership (AVR) requirement has not been achieved in the past reporting cycle.  This report also summarizes staff’s work with three  other properties that are, consistent with development agreement requirements, implementing additional transportation demand management measures to achieve the numeric peak-hour AVR targets identified in each Agreement. These three properties are Colorado Center, Provi dence Saint John’s Health Center , and Crossroads School.  Staff will continue its ongoing and annual review of compliance reports for each Agreement submitted by the developers or successors-in-interest to demonstrate good faith compliance.  The next annual report to Council for all Development Agreements subject to annual compliance reporting is scheduled during the first quarter of 2018. 	Chapter 9.60 of the Municipal Code establishes the processes and requirements for the City to enter into a Development Agreement.  One of the provisions is annual review by the City Council of each approved Development Agreement to determine good faith compliance with the terms and conditions of the Agreements.  Since the passage of this ordinance in 1982, 32 Development Agreements have been enacted that are still in effect. Each Development Agreement contains unique time frames, obligations, and requirements. The obligations can be one-time or ongoing; some are fees, some are actual physical improvements, and some are ongoing services.  The 32 Development Agreements monitored by the Planning and Community Development (PCD) Department are listed below and include six properties under construction and six properties where construction has not yet commenced.  This includes one project approved since Council’s last annual review of Development Agreement compliance in January 2016: a mixed-use commercial/residential project in the Downtown District at 500 Broadway.  PCD staff works closely with other City departments and divisions to confirm compliance with agreement terms that fit within those departments’ areas of expertise. For example, Housing and Economic Development performs the annual compliance review of affordable housing obligations in Agreements and Community and Cultural Services performs the annual compliance review of child care program obligations. 	As noted above, as a result of staff’s review of all 32 Development Agreements subject to compliance reporting, 19 of the 20 constructed projects have been determined to be in good faith compliance.   Conversely, staff has determined that the Agensys project at 1800 Stewart Street has not achieved good faith compliance.  The status of the Agensys property is discussed in the body of this report. Attachment A summarizes all  other Agreements where annual compliance reports are required and have been submitted for the current review period, provides a brief status update on the projects under construction, and those properties where construction has not yet commenced.  Attachments B and C also provide a summary of TDM program measures that have been incorporated in newly-approved or amended Development Agreements since 2010 in conjunction with the City’s Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) implementation.              2401-2525 Colorado Avenue -  Colorado Place II & II  (Colorado Center)  (1981)    1541 Ocean Ave - Paseo Del Mar  (1982)    2700 Colorado Ave - National Medical Enterprise (Viacom)  (1982)    530 Pico Blvd -  Bayview CA Unlimited Partnership (Le Meridien Delfina)  (1983)    2000-2200 Colorado Ave -  Arboretum (AO Santa Monica) (1987)    1620 26th Street & 2425 Olympic Blvd - Water Garden (1988)    1733 Ocean Ave -  Maguire Thomas (1990)    2221 Santa Monica Blvd -  Providence Saint John’s Health Center (1998)    1776 Main Street - Rand (2000)    3030 Olympic Blvd - Lantana East (2004)                  3030 Olympic Blvd - Lantana South (2004)    1725 Ocean Ave - The Village (2008)    725 California Avenue -  Saint Monica’s Catholic Community (2010)    1800 Stewart St - Agensys (2010)    2834 Colorado Avenue - Colorado Creative Studios (2011)    702 Arizona Avenue (2011)    1317 7 th Street (2011)    401 Broadway (2011)    710 Wilshire Boulevard (2012)    1548 6 th Street (2012)    2930 Colorado Avenue (2013)   1318 2 nd Street (2013)    1731 20 th Street - Crossroads School (2013)    1554 5 th Street - Courtyard by Marriott (2013)   501 Colorado Avenue - Hampton Inn & Suites (2013)   315 Colorado Avenue - Arclight Cinemas at Santa Monica Place (2014)    1402 Santa Monica Blvd - Mini Automobile Dealership (2014)   1112-1122 Pico Blvd (2014)   1415 5 th Street (2015)   1560 Lincoln Blvd (2015)   1601 Lincoln Blvd  (2016)   500 Broadway (2016)   1333-1337 Ocean Avenue - Hill Street Partners III (2007) Expired in 2012   1900 Pico Blvd -  Santa Monica College Parking & Pool  (1989) Expired in 2014   Recommended Finding: Not in Good Faith Compliance  Agreement Effective : 10/28/2010 Expir ation: at termination of ground lease Reporting Period: 10/28/2015 to 10/28/2016 The Agensys Agreement permits a project including the following key components: ·  24,625 square feet for administration offices and entry lobby  ·  45,590 square feet for manufacturing of new cancer treatments  ·  72,050 square feet for research and development  ·  11,390 square feet of meeting rooms, employee amenities including a caf eteria open to the public during lunchtime hours  ·  5,140 square-feet of publicly accessible open space  ·  Publicly-accessible pedestrian path to allow access to the Bergamot Station site and future Expo Line light rail station  ·  Surface parking for 200- 220 cars  Community Benefits Summary ·  Publicly-accessible pedestrian path  ·  Publicly-accessible passive open space along Stewart Street  ·  Widened sidewalk along Stewart Street  ·  Café open to pedestrians during limited daytime hours  ·  TDM Program geare d to the project site’s location within a “Higher Goal” District designated by the Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE)  ·  Sculpture garden with up to 10 sculptures adjacent to the pedestrian path ·  Local hiring program including a job fair and a local hiring policy  ·  Student internship program  ·  Student tours  ·  Signage and way-finding system  ·  Shared parking for events at Bergamot Station  ·  Continued community outreach  ·  Transit contribution toward improved transit infrastructure focused on bicycle access at the light rail station  Construction for the Agensys project began in Spring 2011 and was completed in January 2013.  Staff received the facility’s annual compliance report on November 4, 2016.  All of the site community benefits such as the pedestrian path linking Bergamot Station to Stewart Street, the Sculpture Garden, Pedestrian Café (LIME), public open space, and widened sidewalk were complete with the construction of the project site.  Operational community benefits such as a local hiring program (currently 8% of its workforce is a Santa Monica resident); internship program for Santa Monica College students or Santa Monica residents; Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District student tours; and providing shared parking for special events at Bergamot Station are on-going benefits.  In particular, Agensys has continued its efforts with student tours, lectures, and programs with Santa Monica High School and hosts an annual Family Science Day for elementary, middle school, and high school students in Santa Monica.  Agensys is also preparing for their third sculpture exhibit; works of art are being fabricated and installation is anticipated in March/April 2017.   This new exhibit was reviewed by the Santa Monica Arts Commission and its Public Art Committee in a special joint meeting in September 2016. The exhibit will feature works by Lynn Aldrich, Jeremy Kidd, Bertil Peterssen & Pontus Willfors.  Financial payments of $70,350 for the project’s required Bergamot Station Transit Infrastructure Contribution and $20,000 for bicycle access improvements in the area were verified in January 2014.  Agensys is in good faith compliance with these Agreement requirements outlined above.  The Agensys Development Agreement specifies that Agensys’ initial employee average vehicle ridership requirement shall be 1.6 until such time that the Expo light rail is operational.  More specifically, Agensys is required to achieve a 1.6 AVR rate for the a.m. and p.m. peak-hour periods (6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., respectively). This is due to the project site’s location within a “higher goal” LUCE District for achieving vehicle trip reduction.  The Agensys Agreement also provides that in the event the applicable AVR requirement is not reached in any annual Employee Trip Reduction Plan (ETRP), Agensys shall propose modifications to the TDM program to achieve the AVR requirements by the next ETRP submittal.  This issue of non-compliance with the AVR requirement was also reported on during the last two compliance review cycles for 2014 and 2015. As outlined in last year’s report to Council, the City disagreed with the methodology used for Agensys’ 2015 AVR survey and the validity of the survey results as reported in its annual Employee Trip Reduction Plan (required for large employers per SMMC Chapter 9.53) because the AVR calculation reported by Agensys was based upon a survey that was taken during a period when Agensys provided transportation incentives that were not offered to its employees during times outside the survey period. This disagreement was addressed in accordance with the procedures established for employer monitoring, enforcement, and administrative appeals under the Transportation Demand Management Ordinance.  Agensys resurveyed its employees in the February 2016 and resubmitted its Employee Trip Reduction Plan to the City in March 2016 demonstrating that the facility achieved a 1.54 AM AVR and a 1.48 PM AVR. While the City approved the Agensys’ survey methodology and revised Employee Trip Reduction Plan in April 2016, the facility did not achieve compliance with its Development Agreement requirements of 1.6 AVR for the AM and PM peak periods.  As a result, City staff followed up with Agensys to clarify what additional trip reduction measures would be implemented to achieve the AVR requirement by the next reporting cycle.  City staff met with Agensys on June 2, 2016 and followed up with correspondence and telephone communications over the summer to determine whether the following four additional trip reduction measures were being implemented in accordance with staff’s previous requests:  1.  Provide a daily transportation allowance for all employees who do not drive alone to work that is at least equal to the current monthly transportation allowance ($140) divided by 20, or $7 per day.  2.  Provide a car share or fleet vehicle on-site that may be utilized by all employees who bike, walk, carpool, vanpool, take transit, or otherwise commute to the worksite in a non-SOV vehicle for business and/or personal trips during the workday. This requirement could be met by providing car share subsidies to those employees for an onsite car share vehicle.  3.  Provide employee bike share memberships or a minimum of four on-site Bike@Work bicycles for employees to utilize during the workday for business and/or personal trips during the workday.  4.  Increased marketing of new TDM Plan Enhancements.  As of September 2016, staff was unsuccessful in obtaining confirmation from Agensys regarding implementation of these plan enhancements requested by the City or other substitute measures.  In October 2016, City staff was informed that a new team at Agensys would be taking the lead on TDM Program implementation and related obligations as a large employer pursuant to the City’s Transportation Demand Management Ordinance (SMMC Chapter 9.53).  After several communications regarding timely submittal of Agensys’ annual commute survey, data from Agensys’ survey demonstrated a positive increase since the last survey in February: 1.57 AM AVR and 1.58 PM AVR.  As follow up, City staff met with Agensys’ new Human Resources Director, new Vice President of Technical Operations, and Director of Engineering and Facilities Operations in December 2016.  The parties discussed implementation of the additional TDM measures required to achieve the facility’s AVR requirements, Development Agreement terms, and the difficulties the City has encountered regarding this issue over the past two years. The new team at Agensys committed to renewing their efforts to implement a robust TDM Program, and asked questions about the four additional measures designed to build on the progress made in the last reporting cycle to help achieve the 1.6 peak hour AVR requirements. 	\N	1

California  law  requires  that  her  salary  be  established  and  approved  in  public.  The  vote  on  the  contract  will  establish  her  salary  at $ 23,656 per  month and  fulfill  that  legal  requirement . 	 	 The proposed contract between the City and Ms. Dilg will establish a monthly salary of $23,656.  The contract will specify that Ms. Dilg will receive the same benefits provided to all members of the City's Executive Pay Plan. Additionally, the contract provides for vacation to be accrued at 1.75 days per month which is based on prior years of service in the public sector with an initial bank of 40 hours of vacation and 40 hours of sick leave. The contract also provides for six months’ severance pay. As Ms. Dilg lives in Santa Monica no moving or housing expenses are necessary. 	\N	2
7	The Final Public Hearing Draft Downtown Community Plan and Associated Amendments to the Land use and Circulation Element, Civic Center Specific Plan, Zoning Ordinance, SMMC Chapter 9.53 and SMMC Article 8.	Planning and Community Development	\N	The Downtown Community Plan is a roadmap guiding the evolution of Downtown Santa Monica, a 229-acre area identified by the City’s Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) as bounded by Wilshire Boulevard and the I-10 Freeway, and between Lincoln Boulevard and Ocean Avenue. Taking into account that only 4% of the City lies within Downtown (roughly half a square mile), the DCP lays out a framework that integrates housing, jobs, mobility, historic preservation, public open space, infrastructure, and art and culture into a comprehensive long-term Plan. When adopted, the DCP will guide decision-makers and City departments, property owners and developers, as well as local stakeholder groups who provide services and programs to benefit the health and vitality of Downtown Santa Monica and all those who live, work or play here. Creation of the DCP The path that the DCP has taken to get to this final phase began with the adoption of the LUCE in 2010.  The LUCE set forth goals and policies for an expanded Downtown and called for a Specific Plan (the DCP) to propose strategies and standards to create the conditions for a sustainable urban lifestyle. This vision included expanding cultural arts offerings, and adding both intimate and larger open spaces to the growing residential community. The vision addressed traffic, congestion and pedestrian safety by suggesting upgrades to streetscapes, optimizing the circulation network and integrating the Expo Light Rail into the physical fabric of the community in order meet the needs of all people navigating the Downtown. Priority was assigned to public improvements that would enhance the pedestrian experience and to standards and programs that would foster trip reduction by encouraging transit, walking, and biking as well as Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures.  The planning effort has been guided by substantial community participation and the involvement of the City’s Boards and Commissions, including the City Council.  Throughout the workshops and discussions, public hearings and events, stakeholders have worked assiduously to shape the DCP into a balanced framework that supports residents, business owners, employees, non-profits, property owners and other community stakeholders.  Since initiating the planning process in 2012, several iterations of the DCP have been introduced, including:  ·  September 2013: Downtown Specific Plan Framework . This document included a compilation of the primary components of the Plan including all of the issues that had been discussed to that date. The Framework became the basis of a project description for the Program Environmental Impact Report. ·  February 2014: Draft Downtown Specific Plan . The first release of a comprehensive Downtown Specific Plan came a year later, adding greater detail to the concepts included in the Framework, and weaving together regulatory proposals with policy. The Draft Downtown Specific Plan underwent a major revision and restructuring process in winter 2016. ·  February 2016: Draft Downtown Community Plan . The second full-length version of the Plan was released in February 2016 under a new title of “Downtown Community Plan.” This effort was conducted to recognize the overarching desire to nurture a long-term community within Downtown’s boundaries, and to make sure that every Santa Monica resident feels welcome in the Downtown. The revision included an overhaul of the document that resulted in reformatting, reorganization, and text streamlining.  The Plan was also made more action-oriented, tying key initiatives to phasing periods and responsible parties both within and outside City government. ·  April 2017: Final Public Hearing Draft Downtown Community Plan . The final Public Hearing version of the Plan was released on April 12 th at a public event at the Civic Center’s East Wing.  This updated edition comes on the heels of a full year of extended community outreach, and includes several substantial changes from the 2016 text.  Over the course of April and May of 2017, the Planning Commission provided comments and recommended changes, which are enumerated in the Addenda (Attachment B).  Throughout the various versions of the DCP, the City Council and Boards and Commissions have provided continuous feedback to further refine the Plan’s core tenets and to provide detail in areas where specificity strengthened standards, policies or actions.  The City Council (February 28,2012, July 9, 2013 and October 13, 2015) and Planning Commission (March 16, 2011, January 11, 2012, March 28, 2012, July 11, 2012, December 5, 2012, January 23, 2013, March 6, 2013, July 17, 2013, August 7, 2013, November 2, 2013, November 3, 2015, March 2, 2016, March 3, 2016, November 16, 2016, December 7, 2016, April 25, 2017, May 10, 2017, May 11, 2017, May 17, 2017, May 18, 2017, May 31, 2017 ) have held public hearings and provided significant input into the planning process, shaping the concepts and strategies over the last 5 years.  Throughout the planning period, the planning team’s communication approach has been fluid to integrate as many perspectives as possible through a variety of means.  These include public workshops, focus groups, presentations to neighborhood organizations, online surveys, a dedicated interactive project website www.downtownsmplan.org and a variety of fun events such as walking tours, farmer’s market exhibitions and community celebrations for major milestones.  Below is a list of meetings and events that have been conducted with the participation of several thousand people. 	  The Final Downtown Community Plan (Attachment A) presents a vision for Downtown Santa Monica that includes a prioritization for over 2,500 new housing units, as well as new public spaces, a further diversification of art and cultural offerings, a prominent role for historic preservation, and a multi-faceted approach to enhancing Downtown’s pedestrian environment through building setbacks and improved streetscapes, to name but a few.  Designed to be a relatively lower-scale 5-7 story Downtown, the DCP envisions that change will happen incrementally and be accompanied by infrastructure investments, including enhancements to the mobility network, that support the needs of a growing population.  Refining the LUCE Vision The 2010 LUCE defined newly expanded boundaries for Downtown.  The LUCE brought in all areas west of Lincoln Boulevard into the planning boundary to increase Downtown’s footprint and to concentrate desired housing, jobs and community-serving uses near the terminus of the Expo light rail.  Noting the inherent challenges faced by Downtown to maintain Santa Monica’s small-town vibrancy and flavor, the LUCE directed the City and community to develop a Specific Plan “to determine the appropriate range of building heights in the district and address the need for open space, affordable and workforce housing, pedestrian access from areas south of the Downtown core, the linkages from Downtown to the Beach and the incorporation of the Downtown Light Rail Station into the fabric of the Downtown. (LUCE Policy D14.1)” After six years of Plan development, outreach and public discussions, the DCP has struck a balance to meet the challenges identified in the LUCE. The DCP creates the conditions for a lively pedestrian-oriented mix of uses and activities, including new housing options that are complemented by services and public spaces to create a complete neighborhood. It further strengthens Downtown’s identity by safeguarding City designated historic resources and potential historic resources through a comprehensive preservation approach, and marries this to the creation of “new landmarks” that will spring from flexible development standards that inspire creativity and innovation at a scale that is consistent with Santa Monica’s contemporary urban form. Lastly, the DCP continues to rely on the concept that pedestrians come first in Downtown Santa Monica. Addressing the full range of mobility in the Downtown relies on building on the investments already in place and strategic investment in infrastructure and programs to the meet the transportation needs of Downtown.  As a comprehensive document, the DCP provides substantial policy guidance on all of the elements mentioned above, such that the Council and its Boards and Commissions will have a framework for making decisions about public investments, or judging the merit of proposals that are submitted by private individuals who wish to effect any manner of change Downtown.  Significantly, the DCP also provides a suite of actions that the City itself will use to develop departmental and interagency workplans around infrastructure upgrades, public space enhancement, economic development, historic preservation, and mobility. These actions, implemented in coordination with a monitoring program that includes a cap on the volume of development evaluated under the Plan’s EIR, will guide city leaders to carefully steward the evolution of Downtown in a manner that is consistent with the long-term goals of the community for sustainability, resilience and well-being.  This report summarizes the core components of the Downtown Community Plan and provides information on the substantive outreach process, as well as input from the Planning Commission and other Boards and Commission that have weighed-in on the final draft.  For clarity, the report is organized into the following three chapters:  1.  THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN  2.  PLAN DEVELOPMENT AND FEEDBACK  3.  COUNCIL CONSIDERATIONS A.  Urban Design and Land Use Strategy For the past century, Downtown Santa Monica’s built environment has responded to various eras of change.  From its infancy as a crossroads of commerce and civic life, to its present day role as bustling local hangout and job/tourist center Downtown’s buildings stand as a record of human endeavor, and as a reflection of the zoning standards that each subsequent generation implemented to guide the urban form priorities of the day.  This incremental approach is responsible for the great diversity of building heights Downtown, which range from one-story brick and mortar structures to taller twenty-one-story glass and steel buildings.  The DCP acknowledges the interplay between the old and new as a necessary ingredient to Downtown’s authenticity, and presents an urban design strategy to safeguard the identifiable historic core within the Bayside Conservation District, and transfer unused development potential to the areas immediately served by the Expo Light Rail.  The 5-7 story height profile proposed by the DCP is framed by 4-story transition zones that gradually reduce height and scale at Downtown’s outer edges where it abuts the residential neighborhoods of Wilmont and Mid-City, and where views of the Pacific Ocean open up on Ocean Avenue. The development standards for the Plan’s six land use districts (Bayside Conservation, Neighborhood Village, Transit Adjacent, Lincoln Transition, Wilshire Transition, Ocean Transition) derive from the urban design strategy and provide equilibrium between the community’s desire to protect the historic scale of Downtown’s central walking area centered on the Third Street Promenade with the need to accommodate additional residential and commercial activities in areas that are regionally connected by transit. Land Use Downtown’s vibrancy is attributed to its unique mix of shops, restaurants, offices, institutions, health and well-being centers, entertainment venues, markets, apartments, and dozens of other offerings that are used daily by locals, employees and visitors. As the expanded boundaries of Downtown begin to transition into a mixed-use environment, the DCP provides a logical structure for regulating land uses in a way that is complimentary to the urban design strategy by directing the most intensive pedestrian-oriented uses to the historic core and transit area, and limiting the presence of larger more regionally-sized commercial uses adjacent to residential areas. This framework supports the DCP’s Land Use Regulations, which are finely-tuned to balance the Downtown’s various roles as urban neighborhood, regional job center and visitor destination. Urban Form and Building Design Santa Monica is renowned as a center of innovation and creativity, often leading the region - if not the nation – on issues of sustainability, community enrichment and urban policy.  These practices are woven throughout many adopted City documents, such as the Zoning Ordinance, that influence building design both in our commercial areas as well as in our residential neighborhoods.  In Downtown, the City has the opportunity to embody these principles in a new urban typology that celebrates architectural expression through flexible design standards.  The DCP departs from the rigid formulas of the past several decades that have produced “wedding cake” buildings, and instead employs a suite of percentage-based modulation requirements that allow for an architectural concept to drive building design. These standards, which ensure a consistent pedestrian-scaled streetwall, interior access to light and air, and communal open spaces for building residents, provide designers with a comfortable canvas for exemplary architecture while empowering planners and reviewing bodies with sufficient criteria to evaluate the merit of individual projects.  In response to comments received from the design community during the Planning Commission’s deliberations on the draft DCP, avenues for alternative compliance or modifications to standards along with strategic exemptions from standards for single lot projects were added to the Planning Commission’s recommended changes.  The Architectural Review Board (ARB) discussed the Downtown Community Plan at both their June 5, 2017 and June 19, 2017 meetings and generally endorsed the urban design strategy and urban form approach.  There was a robust exchange of ideas including discussion of design standards, modulation standards and design guidelines, the Bayside Conservation District and attention to potential historic resources and Landmark properties, open space provisions, as well as other aspects of the plan. The ARB Subcommittee also made many specific recommendations, identifying conflicts within the plan that needed clarification, and highlighting technical architectural items to be addressed with greater precision.  These items have been addressed in the staff-recommended Addenda (Attachment C).  The ARB is generally supportive of the Downtown Community plan presented.  The ARB had a particular interest and concern regarding the modulation standards and were focused on ensuring the adopted standards do not prevent or hinder innovation and/or excellence in design.  To that end, the ARB would like to support the following implementation actions:  ·  Add to Chapter 6, Implementation Actions a report on whether the development standards have resulted in desired outcomes.  The change is recommended on Page 249, Item 5A, Enforcement of Project Entitlements, “Review the design quality of downtown project to ensure diverse design typologies, innovation and quality design.” ·  The Board strongly endorses the use of resources such as the Downtown Santa Monica Inc. Ambassador Program and outreach to private property owners regarding possible management partnerships to ensure successful outdoor spaces are incorporated into existing and new projects. ·  The Board also endorses the action to develop a Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District (NCOD) in the Bayside Conservation District (BSCD).  Staff has added the ARB’s proposed implementation action to the staff-recommended Addenda.  Since the June ARB meetings, the Board’s DCP subcommittee submitted a recommendation to add a special alternative stepback option for all Districts.  The proposal would allow “forms, geometries, and skins such as layered facades and brise-soleils that do not fit the modulation standards but generally conform to the intent for three-dimensional design and to ensure light and air into buildings and down to the street to be considered on a case-by-case basis through discretionary review.” To this point, staff notes that the Plan already allows for architectural projections beyond the building frontage line for 2/3 of the façade and therefore, believes the forms and geometries contemplated by the ARB subcommittee would be accommodated within the Plan’s allowable projections. The Downtown Community Plan is a Housing Plan The Downtown Community Plan’s primary responsibility is to respond to the direction of the LUCE to encourage the growth of the residential population Downtown. This strategic land use emphasis is intended to accommodate the unmet demand for new housing in Santa Monica by directing the production of over 2,500 new units to an area that is rich with public transportation options and where higher densities can support a more sustainable development pattern. The primacy of housing development is highlighted in the DCP by policy and Plan standards that provide incentives to encourage the production of new housing units, both market-rate and affordable to people of lower incomes. The Housing Commission supports the DCP’s approach to housing production.  Housing Incentives ·  Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Bonus: housing projects have access to an additional 0.5 FAR bonus over commercial projects of a similar size. ·  Height Bonus on Lincoln and Wilshire Boulevards: housing projects on Lincoln and Wilshire Boulevard may achieve the maximum permitted height of the districts, whereas commercial projects are subject to a 10-foot reduction from the maximum permitted height. ·  PC RECOMMENDED: Process Incentives: entitlements for housing projects enjoy higher development review thresholds than their commercial counterparts. o  Housing projects up to 60,000 square feet (on lots no greater than 15,000 square feet) throughout the Downtown shall be processed through an Administrative Approval. o  Tier 3 housing projects up to 90,000 square feet in the Transit Adjacent District shall be processed through a Development Review Permit.  Affordable Housing Requirements In addition to the housing incentives that are provided in the DCP’s Standards and Regulations, affordable housing production will be stimulated by new requirements for Tier 2 and non-negotiated Tier 3 projects.  These requirements were determined based upon feasibility analyses prepared by HR&A (Attachment I). ·  Uniform Affordable Housing Requirement by Height: the DCP proposes a modified framework for affordable housing, compared to existing regulations, that requires a single percentage of on-site or off-site housing, depending on the proposed height of the project. ·  Increased On-site Affordable Housing Requirements: the DCP requires a greater percentage of deed-restricted affordable units than currently required. ·  Augmented Off-Site Affordable Housing Requirements: projects that wish to satisfy their Affordable Housing requirement off-site of the market-rate project will be subject to an even higher percentage of deed-restricted affordable units than the on-site equivalent.  Based on the Planning Commission’s review of the DCP Affordable Housing proposal, the distance that an off-site project can be located from its related market-rate project has been expanded to anywhere within the Downtown, or within one-quarter mile of the market rate project. ·  Mandated Affordable Income Level Mix: based upon the proportionate household income levels in the Housing Element Regional Housing Needs Assessment and requirements of Proposition R, the revised DCP includes a new requirement to provide a mix of income levels within the total affordable units required for the project so that each project provides units affordable to extremely low, very low, low and moderate incomes.  Exemptions for 100% Affordable Housing Projects ·  PC RECOMMENDED: Administrative Approval Threshold: 100% Affordable Housing projects up to 75 units may be approved administratively. ·  PC RECOMMENDED: Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Bonus: 100% Affordable housing projects in the Neighborhood Village have access to an additional 0.5 FAR bonus and 10 feet of additional height.  The DCP projects an estimated minimum of 2,500 new units produced over the next 15-20 years, which represents a doubling of the residential population that emerged over the past three decades. Most of the new housing projects will include a healthy mix of unit sizes and affordability levels based on the DCP’s policy direction and project requirements. It is important to note that 2,500 new units is a projection, not an absolute number, and could be increased upwards due to market forces that favor housing production over other land uses, such as commercial office or retail.  The DCP’s housing strategy and project requirements were reviewed by the Housing Commission at meetings on June 15, 2017 and June 20, 2017.  The Housing Commission endorses most aspects of the DCP’s housing approach including incentives for 100% affordable housing projects.  However, the Housing Commission recommends that additional project or process requirements be contemplated further. Many of these recommendations include changes to proposed measures in the Plan including ·  Eliminating CUP requirement for SRO projects ·  Rejecting the process incentives for housing projects recommended by the Planning Commission ·  Prohibiting any offsite affordable housing within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway ·  Ensuring that the Housing Element Quantified Objective and Proposition R production requirements have been met before middle-income units (130%-180% AMI as indicated in DCP) could be considered in development agreement negotiations  The inclusion of SRO projects as a permitted use is a change that will be reflected in the use table.  The streamlined process for typical housing projects recommended by the Planning Commission was based on the need to create a clear and predictable process for housing projects as compared to commercial projects.  To provide context to the location of offsite affordable housing, the Planning Commission discussed the limitation of residential uses within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway but did not impose any locational restrictions.  Further, much of the Transit Adjacent district is within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway.  Development agreement negotiations are conducted on a case-by-case basis so there would be no obligation to include any middle-income units.  The Housing Commission also made several recommendations that extend beyond the scope of what has been in the public discourse or in proposals presented by staff or the community, including: ·  A graduated affordable housing requirement that escalates up to 35% based on allowable height and FAR thresholds ·  Eliminating any office or retail uses above the ground floor for new buildings, with exceptions for areas that the Council deems appropriate. ·  Applying project requirements (i.e. affordability mix and average bedroom factor) to offsite 100% affordable housing projects with an exemption from the requirements only if necessary to obtain other forms of public financing ·  Biennial review of DCP Affordable Housing and AHPP requirements to determine if new incentives or requirements should be instituted ·  Encouraging ground floor residential units to have a preference for low-income disabled persons and artists, subject to City Attorney review regarding any fair housing implications ·  Reviewing the entire AHPP now for consistency with Prop R income targeting and rent limits and revise the affordability requirements outside of Downtown based upon new feasibility studies similar to that conducted for the DCP ·  Increasing deed-restriction terms on affordable units from 55 years to the life of the project ·  Identifying publically-owned land as a potential resource to achieve affordable housing goals  Staff appreciates the thoughtful detail that the Housing Commission put into their recommendations, some of which fall outside of the regulatory framework of the DCP in terms of deed restriction term limits and the framework of the AHPP.  Staff defers to Council on the subject of modified affordable housing requirements, but notes that a careful balance has been struck within the DCP between project requirements, fees, and process.  Any recommendation must also be supported by the HR&A feasibility analysis.  The elimination of office or retail space above the ground floor may appear attractive as a means to create housing projects but prohibiting office and retail above the ground floor must be carefully considered in balance with other uses that are vital to the City’s economy, social services network, or other important land uses that create a complete community.  The draft DCP proposes that offsite affordable housing projects must be owned in whole or part and operated by a non-profit housing provider.  It is likely that these providers will seek public financing that will dictate the affordability requirements of the project, which is why the DCP exempts 100% affordable housing projects from the project requirements for Tier 2 and Tier 3 projects.  However, there may be an instance where an offsite affordable housing project is completely privately financed.  In this case, the project would still be required to comply with the definition of a 100% affordable housing project per Section 9.52.020.0050 of the Zoning Ordinance (25% of units affordable to 60% income households with remainder affordable to 80% income households).  From a policy perspective, the net result is more affordable housing units and therefore, flexibility should be provided in how the offsite affordable housing is achieved.  With respect to preference for artists, a new policy has also been included to explore accommodating artists within ground floor residential units provided the classifications do not result in unintended discriminatory impacts.  The DCP includes a monitoring requirement that would produce a report concurrent with the LUCE monitoring.  The monitoring report would include data presented as part of the Proposition R annual reports.  Staff does not support a requirement that the DCP affordable housing requirements be reviewed every two years as there may not be sufficient data points to inform such a study. The Preservation of Existing Buildings is Strongly Supported Preserving the historic scale and character of Downtown’s beloved walking areas is a central objective of the DCP’s change strategy, which seeks to carefully retain many older structures that evoke nostalgia for Santa Monica’s colorful past.  The DCP improves upon previous historic preservation policies, and provides substantial support for adaptive reuse.  A six-step approach outlines a variety of economic and technical incentives.  Adaptive Reuse Incentives Exemptions from standard development requirements have been added to the DCP that create economic and technical incentives for owners of properties identified as City Designated Historic Resources or as potential historic resources. Several examples include exemptions from development standards, such as parking, open space, and certain use regulations that would create barriers to adaptive reuse. It should be noted that other technical incentives are available such as the California Historical Building Code, which recognizes older buildings often need alternative methods in meeting fire and life safety requirements.   Protections for Historic Resources A new protection included in the DCP is an action to submit the Downtown Historic Resource Inventory (HRI) to the State Office of Historic Preservation, which would mean that all HRI-listed properties are considered presumptive historic resources under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). CEQA requires that exterior alterations to historic resources comply with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.  If alterations are not in conformance or demolition is proposed, more detailed environmental review of the proposed project would be required, possibly including an Environmental Impact Report.  Several new process changes are also included in the DCP to facilitate the conservation of City Designated Historic Resources and potential historic resources Downtown. These include modified demolition screening procedures that require Landmarks Commission review of demolition permits for structures more than 40 years old and clearance of the required 75-day waiting period before any Planning application can be submitted.  This new procedure would serve as a means to identify potential historic resources prior to the submittal of an application, which would be complemented with an associated amendment to SMMC Article 8 (Building Regulations) to increase the lifespan for demolition applications.  Future actions to support this process change include updating the Landmarks Ordinance to provide alternative pathways to designation and the creation of a Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District within the Bayside Conservation District to identify design features that provide visual identity to 2 nd and 4 th Streets. Special standards for the Bayside Conservation District include eliminating the open space requirements and relaxed modulation requirements in order to clearly define the traditional streetwall of 2 nd and 4 th Streets. The Landmarks Commission reviewed the DCP’s approach to Historic Preservation at their June 12, 2017 meeting and supports the approach subject to the following recommended changes: ·  Specify possible funding sources for historic preservation ·  Assure that the existing provisions in the Municipal Code for expediting plan check occur in practice ·  Increase outreach and public education regarding historic preservation ·  Amend Policy HP2.4 to read, “Adaptive reuse of older building should be considered for new construction and rehabilitation projects, when the scale, materials or method of construction evokes Downtown’s history, and where the façade  building contributes to a continuous streetscape.” Staff supports the Landmarks Commission’s recommendations and has added relevant changes to the recommended Addenda. Going forward, staff will continue to look for opportunities to realize existing incentives for historic preservation, and to help expand outreach on this subject. New Public and Open Spaces are Prioritized throughout Downtown Because Downtown was largely developed as a commercial district it contains very few dedicated public spaces where groups can congregate.  While many of the existing parks or public spaces that are utilized by Downtown residents and visitors are located nearby in other districts (e.g. Tongva Park, Palisades Park, Reed Park); within Downtown, only the public right of way, and places like the Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica Place, and the Santa Monica Main Library serve as Downtown’s dedicated public open space offerings.  Recognizing this, the community overwhelmingly identified the maintenance, enhancement or creation of public space as the #1 priority for Downtown’s evolution.  The DCP looks at the public space network comprehensively, and acknowledges that a nuanced approach that involves both City and private interests must be considered.  To this end, the Plan emphasizes the role that private development must play to add new public spaces to Downtown.  The DCP identifies key sites where development has been proposed and where negotiations with property owners may yield significant public open space.  Similarly, the Public Space plan includes existing publically-accessible spaces (“POPs”) that should be redesigned to promote better access and programming, perhaps incentivized with a small modicum of new floor area.  Management and oversight of these spaces is paramount, and will require the involvement of City staff, DTSM and private property owners.  Based on outreach, smaller scale public spaces such as pocket parks, courtyards and plazas are preferred over larger open spaces such as a central park or recreation fields.   Additionally, the quality of Downtown’s streetscapes is to be improved to emphasize their role as public spaces and the opportunity they provide to further pedestrianize the area through wider sidewalks, a larger more verdant urban forest, and street furnishings that would make the walking experience more enjoyable.  Private Open Space in Housing Projects A new feature of the DCP’s zoning standards is the requirement for typical housing projects to provide on-site open space for residents’ use.  Depending on the size of the project area, a project is required to dedicate 20-25% of the total lot area to courtyards, rooftop gardens, balconies and other open space types, and of this percentage one-quarter must be designed for communal use. Single-lot projects are exempt from these standards.  The Recreation and Parks Commission (RPC) reviewed the DCP’s Public Space approach at their December 15, 2016 meeting and subsequently provided a letter expressing unanimous support for the various approaches and policies surrounding the creation or enhancement of public open spaces Downtown.  The RPC conditioned their support on several recommendations, including:  ·  That the DCP maximize every opportunity to create open space, including true green space, courtyards, plazas and paseos; ·  That the DCP identify parcels that would be suitable for acquisition for open space use; ·  That the DCP include policies reflecting the need to work with private property owners to activate empty plazas; ·  That ground floor open space be included in all residential projects; ·  That projects subject to DAs provide substantial open space benefits and that property owners should be held accountable for maintaining open space amenities to the highest levels.  Nearly all of the RPC’s recommendations have been addressed and incorporated into the final draft DCP. The one exception is the recommendation to require ground floor open space, which was not integrated into the final plan as it would conflict with the broader urban design strategy to maintain a consistent streetwall at the ground floor.  Encouraging Economic Vitality is Important to Downtown’s Future Downtown is a major employment center (approx. 25,000 jobs) and a revenue generator that supports the many programs, services and activities that residents citywide have come to enjoy. While constituting only 4.5% of the City, Downtown’s generates over a third of the total sales tax revenues for Santa Monica, and another third of all hotel room revenues citywide.  Additionally, fees collected from development to fund park maintenance, childcare programs, urban runoff projects, and transportation enhancements are largely drawn from projects located in Downtown. The combination of these elements has helped Downtown, and the city as a whole, weather challenging financial crises such as the Great Recession.  Given its prominence as Silicon Beach and a major tourist destination, one of Downtown’s inherent tensions is the degree to which it caters to locals, employees and visitors alike.  The challenge ahead is to ensure that it remains a place for everyone, and that opportunities for economic diversity are embraced.  The DCP weaves together policies and standards that create a “local business-friendly” environment that can provide space for a broad mix of job opportunities in new and expanding industries whether they be creative office and co-working spaces, retail, dining and entertainment, or hospitality. The Promenade is further supported through a variety of exemptions from design standards to allow for greater flexibility, and through a change to several regulations that currently restrict uses.  Going forward, an Action of the DCP is to work with Public Works and DTSM, Inc. on a Promenade improvement project to enhance its infrastructure, lighting and right-of-way features.  In the course of outreach, a clear preference emerged to support the creative economy, and to expand opportunities for local entrepreneurialism with small and medium-sized businesses.  To this end, the draft DCP includes a variety of changes from the zoning ordinance that are intended to reduce regulatory barriers for small businesses and typical changes of use. These include relaxed parking standards and less restrictive use regulations that ensure ground floor uses reflect the appropriate level of activity based on adjacency to residential uses.  The Downtown Santa Monica Inc. Board of Directors (DTSM) conducted a comprehensive review of the draft DCP and while there is agreement on many of the key approaches, there remains concern regarding the distribution of heights and densities across Downtown and the effect on housing production.  DTSM highlighted six key recommendations for the Council’s consideration: ·  Increase height and FAR in the BC and NV districts to 84 feet and FAR of 4.0 and to 60 feet and FAR of 2.75 for both sides of the Lincoln Transition district. ·  Provide streamlined process for granting flexibility from all aspects of retail space design and configuration standards to respond to the shifting retail environment. ·  Include a clear vision for a new state-of-the-art movie theater on the site of either Parking Structure #1 or #3. ·  Support for allowing ground floor office in midblock locations in the Neighborhood Village district as demand may not be sufficient to support retail in these locations resulting in vacancies detrimental to the neighborhood. ·  Include a clear statement on improvements to vehicle circulation with inclusion of a Vehicle Action Plan, similar in scope to Bike and Pedestrian Action Plans. ·  Consider flexibility in desired widths for sidewalk zones in order to accommodate space for outdoor dining.  As discussed later in the report highlighting issues for Council consideration, policy options are presented to address housing production and ground floor office in Neighborhood Village midblock locations.  The proposed heights and FARs in the Plan have been carefully crafted within the context of the urban design strategy to place the highest intensities closest to the Expo Station and to balance new development with the existing character of Downtown.  DTSM’s recommendations on a modification process for retail configuration are already included in the draft Plan.  Language regarding support for movie theaters is also included in the Addenda.  The sidewalk widths in the Plan are provided as conceptual illustrations and will be more comprehensively reviewed as part of the follow-up action to create a Downtown Streetscape Manual for how the public right-of-way is used and managed.  As discussed in the following section, the Plan proposes a comprehensive Mobility approach that addresses improvements for all modes.  A New Model for Mobility: Improving Today, Preparing for the Future A new model for mobility includes making more transportation options attractive, convenient, affordable, and safer so that people feel they can circulate without driving alone. It is an evolution of how people get to Downtown, and how they experience traveling within Downtown.  The creation of parking structures may have revived Downtown, Expo service has provided a new transit option, while the future is expected to include travel by driverless vehicles.  The ‘park once, pedestrians first’ mantra has been a guiding tenet for the past 30 years in Downtown. Recently Expo light rail service, pedestrian scramble intersections, a bike center, bicycle lanes and bike share have been introduced to Downtown. The next phase will likely see more changes related to car service (Lyft, Uber, taxi), increasing demand for curb space, and technology. Success of the area is tied to the success of the pedestrian environment – continuing to be a place that residents and visitors both want to walk from place to place.  Transportation in Downtown is as diverse as the people who travel there. Downtown is a place that welcomes the service workers who make it function, as much as resident visitors and tourists – who may take a bus, ride the train, drive with friends, or take a tour bus. People come in buses, carpools, on foot and by bike and walk throughout the district. Providing a quality transportation experience requires flexibility to make it more effective for all of these roadway users. This includes measuring our performance in making streets serve people first, and prioritizing modes that are more efficient.  A new focus in the DCP is the quickly-evolving technology influence on transportation, including electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and transit service provided by private organizations.  Since the inception of the development of this plan, car services, have gained widespread acceptance. The City’s response must be internal, by shaping choices so that the convenient option also meets community values, and external, by actively participating in the field of changing technology. The plan includes recommendations to work with businesses to provide micro-transit, to use technology to provide on-demand transit service, to focus on community priorities such as equitable access to autonomous vehicles, and to participate in regional transportation technology efforts. A new model for mobility requires changes to policies, new investments, different requirements for property owners, adapting business practices, and partnership with the Santa Monica community.  Art and Cultural Offerings Create New Opportunities Downtown The demand for new and more diverse art, cultural and entertainment activities is increasing Downtown. To establish Downtown’s identity as a major cultural center, the City must carefully consider new opportunities for cultural engagement to stretch Downtown’s vibrancy. Building from the traditionally retail-centered economic base, events, major artworks, unique creative expressions and live music will infuse the street and public spaces to strengthen Santa Monica’s as a cultural destination. Additional entertainment choices Downtown, particularly nighttime venues, will provide residents, employees and visitors with a wider array of destination experiences than in the past, such as live performance spaces for theater and live music. The Arts Commission supports the DCP’s approach to Art and Culture.  The DCP’s land use regulations now permit a larger range of art and cultural uses than historically permitted in the past.  The Plan includes an invitation to potential museum operators to work with the City to locate a museum Downtown, and identifies several locations where major works of public art could be located.  At its November 21, 2016 meeting the Arts Commission enthusiastically supported the inclusion of arts and culture into the DCP, and offered the several recommendations, which have largely been incorporated into the final Plan:  ·  Encourage policies and public/private partnerships that promote robust artistic activities throughout downtown, in businesses, open spaces and vacant storefronts. ·  Support Creative Placemaking efforts that enhance other city goals, such as mobility and activating open spaces. ·  Wherever possible, the DCP should ease restrictions and streamline procedures to facilitate pop-up art interventions in underutilized spaces. ·  Encourage the development of public and public/private open space, and provide incentives for artists and arts groups to work with City Cultural Affairs staff to develop and implement art and Creative Placemaking programs downtown. ·  Position Downtown Santa Monica as a cultural destination ·  Expand options for live music and the performing arts in downtown facilities and businesses. ·  Of the affordable housing that is produced Downtown, 10% of the units should be designed and set aside for artist housing or live/work units.  The DCP directly addresses all of the recommendations of the Arts Commission through its policy framework and subsequent implementation actions with the exception of the Arts Commission’s recent request that artist housing or live/work units be included as part of the DCP’s affordable housing requirements.  Additional refinements have been recorded in the recommended Addenda that reflect specific direction on certain actions.  Community Wellbeing The City’s Wellbeing Project looks beyond traditional performance measures or economic indicators and uses a new method to gain an understanding of how all of these factors interact and affect residents’ quality of life. The core of the project is the Wellbeing Index, which provides the City with a snapshot of its current wellbeing strengths and needs by analyzing data collected from residents, city departments and social media to gain a robust understanding of how the people of Santa Monica are doing across multiple measures known to influence wellbeing.  The Wellbeing Index demonstrates that Downtown residents benefit from many positive dimensions, such as access to healthy food, proximity to culturally enriching experiences and institutions, use and enjoyment of Downtown’s outdoor spaces, and frequent use of the many mobility options provided. However, the Index also points to areas of concern that highlight the growing pains of a residential neighborhood in its infancy.  The metrics for stress, stability and life/work balance all register slightly higher Downtown than any other neighborhood in the city.  One indicator of particular concern to the planning team reveals that Downtown residents do not feel connected to one another in the way that fosters community, trust among neighbors, and social interaction. Tying the results of the Index to Plan policies and standards strengthens the logic for prioritizing affordable housing, public open space, new neighborhood serving uses, youth and senior services, and many others.  The Social Services Commission submitted their recommendations to the Planning Commission on April 26, 2017.  Specifically, the Social Services Commission recommended the use of the Wellbeing Project data to guide development agreement negotiations and be used as a tool to advance a diverse and multigenerational Downtown community, support for affordable housing, and specificity for policies supporting wraparound community and social services to serve the Downtown community.  Recommendations that development projects include setasides for affordable/low-cost office space and community rooms could not be included due to lack of nexus between such requirements and new development; however, such amenities could be included in negotiated projects.  Many of the Social Services Commission’s recommendations were included in the Planning Commission’s final recommendation on the DCP. B.  IMPLEMENTING AND MONITORING THE PLAN Implementation of the DCP will be a shared responsibility. Chapter 6 outlines all actions in the Plan along with a relative estimate of cost, responsibility, timing, and potential funding sources (Table 6.1 of the draft Plan).  This can used as a budgeting tool and also as a means to support grant applications.  Table 6.1 demonstrates that implementation of the DCP will be a shared responsibility dependent on not only City leadership but also coordination with community partnerships and cooperation from private entities.  The DCP monitoring report will be prepared concurrent with the LUCE 5-year Measuring and Monitoring Report.  One key area that will be monitored is the development cap of 3.2M square feet of net new floor area in Downtown.  This development cap represents the amount of new development that could occur that would still allow achievement of the LUCE goal of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips.  Any project proposal that exceeds the cap would not be able to be approved until additional environmental analysis and amendments have been completed.  There are also other indicators to monitor the performance of the DCP listed on Page 247-249 of the draft Plan. A.  COMMUNITY OUTREACH Many years of outreach have marked the development of the DCP. Interdepartmental staff and the planning team have worked with community stakeholders and the City’s Boards and Commissions to tackle challenging issues in search of consensus, and have listened intently to the perspectives brought forward by the many voices involved in shaping the Plan.  Beginning in 2012, outreach on the DCP has taken on many forms, from workshops on Emerging Themes, Community Benefits, and Urban form, to stakeholder interviews and meetings with the Planning Commission and City Council.  In total, seven workshops were held to drill into Plan concepts and generate feedback from the community. At the onset of 2016, staff re-engaged the community on a variety of topics to move closer towards consensus and to refine the Plan.  2016 Outreach and Engagement Beginning shortly after the Planning Commission’s March 2 nd , 2016 meeting, staff launched an unprecedented outreach campaign to community groups and local organizations, employing the City’s Office of Communications as a partner in diversifying the input opportunities and in reaching new voices within the community. The outreach tools and platforms used to engage thousands of people were expansive and yielded greater detail about the community’s preference for things like open space, art and culture, mobility, jobs and housing and historic preservation. Importantly, the outreach also demonstrated that there are a great many perspectives on height, development and planning for large sites that have the ability to support much desired amenities.  A detailed breakdown of the 2016 outreach and supporting documentation is provided in the November 16, 2016 Planning Commission staff report. Below is a snapshot of last year’s outreach by the numbers:  ·  1,200 people provided feedback on Downtown priorities in workshops, focus groups and online ·  Over 40 community presentations were given to local groups and organizations in both English and Spanish ·  7 community conversation focus groups were held at the Main Public Library and at Senior Residences Downtown ·  3 public workshops were held on the subjects of Placemaking, Preservation and Change and Mobility ·  3 Downtown walking tours were co-hosted by the planning team and the Santa Monica Conservancy ·  4.6 million social media impressions were recorded on facebook, twitter and instagram ·  8,700 unique visits to the DCP website, www.downtownsmplan.org  Leading up to the release of the 2017 Final Draft Downtown Community Plan, staff held several events to provide a broad overview into the content of the Plan and to establish a rapport with interested community members who sought clarifications on key subjects or who had questions about the collective vision for Downtown’s future.  B.  ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a Program Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared that analyzed the potential environmental effects associated with the DCP.  The Draft Program EIR was circulated for a 90 day public review period beginning on February 3, 2016 (exceeding the minimum 45-day public review as required by Section 15067 of the CEQA Guidelines). In addition, a Recirculated Draft EIR was circulated for a 45-day public review period in February 2017 to reflect changes that were made to the draft DCP.  Comments on the Draft EIR and Recirculated Draft EIR included public concerns about development in Downtown, the Miramar established large site, height, traffic, aesthetics, and neighborhood character. The Final EIR provides written responses to all comments received on the Draft EIR and Recirculated Draft EIR. Some minor text changes and clarification were also included in the Final EIR.  The Final EIR analyzes the effect of potential land use changes that could occur in the Downtown through 2030 as a result of the implementation of the DCP, including review of the range of impacts between two different buildout scenarios. Scenario A (High Scenario) would entail higher FARs for sites in the Downtown with variation by district, and represents the City Council’s outside parameters for EIR analysis established during the August 13, 2013 meeting, which includes FARs up to 5.0 for the established large sites. Scenario B has a lower range of FARs, with up to 4.0 FAR for the established large sites. Scenario B represents a maximum cap of 3.22 million sf of net new floor area in the Downtown.  The Final EIR identifies significant and unavoidable impacts for air quality, construction effects, construction noise, cultural resources, and traffic. Specifically because the details of specific future projects occurring in the Downtown are unknown, the Final EIR concludes that construction-related air emissions and noise (vibration) would be significant and unavoidable. Furthermore, although the DCP would establish greater preservation policies and standards, the Final EIR concludes that historic impacts would be significant and unavoidable since individual projects could involve the demolition or alteration of a historic resource. Additionally, due to the City’s stringent thresholds for traffic and the existing levels of traffic in Downtown, the Final EIR identifies significant and unavoidable impacts with respect to traffic (automobile delay). Aesthetic impacts of the DCP, including those due to building height, are considered less than significant pursuant to Section 21099 of the CEQA Statute, which states that aesthetic impacts of residential, mixed use, and employment center projects in transit priority areas are considered less than significant.  Most importantly, the Final EIR concludes that Scenario B of the DCP (with 3.2 million sf cap) would achieve the goals of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips by 2030, and would reduce per capita vehicles miles traveled (VMT) and greenhouse gas emissions, which is consistent with the intent of SB743 and upcoming changes to CEQA. Additionally, as noted in the Final EIR, the DCP implements the sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction goals and policies established in the City’s LUCE, Sustainable City Plan, Climate Action Plan, and SCAG’s Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy. The DCP is based on a vision of supporting and enhancing the Downtown as a multi-modal district that is fully integrated with the Downtown Station of the Expo LRT. The DCP also emphasizes new land uses in areas proximate to the Downtown Station to minimize vehicle trip generation, vehicle miles traveled, and associated GHG emissions. Additionally, the Plan would enhance multi-modal relationships, calling for new connections and circulation improvements for all modes as well as aggressive TDM measures such as employer trip reduction plans and subsidized transit passes or transportation allowances for residents and employees. Collectively, the standards, policies, and programs in the DCP would support sustainability and GHG reduction goals established by the State, region, and City.  As required under CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(a), the Final EIR includes a discussion and evaluation of "a reasonable range of alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly obtain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives." The EIR provides a robust analysis of the DCP as well the following alternatives. The alternatives analysis provides City decision-makers with a reasonable range of alternatives to consider to reduce or avoid impacts. ·  Alternative 1 – No Project Alternative; ·  Alternative 2 – Reduced Project (Elimination of Tier 3) Alternative; ·  Alternative 3 – 4 th /5 th Streets On-Way Streets Circulation Plan; ·  Alternative 4 – Expanded One-way Streets Circulation Plan; and ·  Alternative 5 – Hotel/Tourism-focused Land Use Mix Alternative.  CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6 requires that an EIR identify the Environmentally Superior Alternative to the proposed project from among the alternatives analyzed. If the No Project Alternative is found to be environmentally superior alternative, the EIR also identifies an Environmentally Superior Alternative from among the other alternatives. For a broad policy document such as the DCP, the potential exists that there may not be a clear Environmentally Superior Alternative. An alternative may have some reduced impact levels and other impacts that are greater than the project, while another alternative reduces different impacts. Although CEQA does not provide specific guidance in this matter, where a project has lower impacts in a majority of resource areas and/or substantially lower impacts in especially critical resource areas, this can support a finding that that alternative is environmentally superior.  Alternative 2 (Elimination of Tier 3 Projects) would reduce transportation-related impacts on intersections; however, elimination of Tier 3 developments would substantially reduce community benefits and substantial affordable housing and multi-modal transportation investment opportunities within the Downtown, potentially resulting in increased vehicles miles traveled. Therefore, in comparing an incremental reduction in the severity of significant impacts with the achievement of Project goals and objectives, the EIR determined that the implementation of Scenario B of the DCP would be the environmentally superior alternative. Implementation of Scenario B would incrementally reduce potential environmental impacts relative to Scenario A, but implementation of Scenario B would also still achieve all of the goals and objectives of the DCP. The Final EIR was presented to Planning Commission for review in April 2017, who recommended certification of the Final EIR.  Adoption of the DCP would require Council certification of the Final EIR, and adoption of a Statement of Overriding Considerations and the mitigation measures identified in the Final EIR.  Mitigation measures are identified in the Final EIR in the areas of Air Quality, Biological Resources, Construction Effects (Air Quality), Cultural Resources, Hazards/Hazardous Materials, Public Services, Utilities, and Transportation and Circulation.  To ensure that these measures are properly enacted, a mitigation monitoring program is necessary and will be enforced during the construction and operation of the project.  C.  PLANNING COMMISSION COMMENTS ON THE PLAN During the months of April and May 2017 the Planning Commission held six public hearings to discuss the DCP (April 25, May 10, May 11, May 17, May 18 and May 31) and its Program Environmental Impact Report. These meetings, which spanned over 40 hours of discussion, also provided the opportunity for the community to comment on the Plan’s content, and for staff to clarify concepts.  The Commission recommended adoption of the DCP with specific amendments and modifications that are listed in Exhibit B to the adopting resolution (Attachment B). The modifications largely pertain to key development standards and Plan policy that encourage the production of housing, as well as the range and location of land uses that are desired for the area.  Housing Production Among the productive clarifications to design standards, mobility actions, open space creation and well-being targets, the Planning Commission’s most impactful recommendations were to increase several housing-related process thresholds to further stimulate housing production Downtown.  Hence, the Commission has recommended that typical mixed-use housing projects up to 60,000 square feet, on lots no greater than 15,000 square feet, be processed ministerially through an Administrative Approval, which would greatly reduce the time necessary to process a development application.  In the Transit Adjacent District, the only area in Downtown that has a Tier 3 option, the Commission recommends a Development Review Permit process for housing projects up to 90,000 square feet.  This process threshold represents the amount of maximum allowable floor area that could result from a project located on a three-lot site of 22,500 square feet.  The Planning Commission’s recommendation was based on overall consensus that this area can support greater densities on account of proximity to the Expo Light Rail.  Comparison of DCP to Planning Commission recommendations for Housing Project Review Process    Less than 30,000 SF Project on lots up to 15,000 SF (typically results in projects less than 60,000 SF) All Tier 2 Tier 3 30,000 - 60,000 SF Tier 2 on lots over 15,000 SF Tier 3 on lots over 15,000 SF and up to 90,000 SF Tier 3 over 60,000 SF Tier 3 over 90,000 SF  Established Large Site Standards and Process Lastly, the Commission spent considerable time discussing the DCP’s options for the Established Large Sites, three sites within Downtown that - given their parcel size - could potentially provide significant community benefits for circulation, open space and cultural facilities that would otherwise not be anticipated from smaller projects. The inclusion of these sites into the Plan sparked the most extensive and spirited debate among Planning Commissioners.  There was consideration of various modifications to the staff recommendation.  In the end, without majority support for any particular approach to these sites, the Commission narrowly recommended (4-3 straw vote) the removal of the Established Large Site Overlay, which provides unique height and FAR standards for these sites.  Commissioners who favored including the Established Large Site Overlay sought to establish the DCP as a comprehensive planning tool that creates clear parameters and expectations for projects on the three sites.  The Commissioners also supported a transparent and rigorous public review process that requires a development agreement, additional environmental review, and includes special application requirements for the applicant to demonstrate how the project meets the DCP’s objectives.  The Commission discussed potentially reducing the maximum height to approximately 100 feet with a setback from Ocean Avenue.  These Commissioners expressed concern about reviewing Specific Plan amendments for individual projects soon after adoption of the DCP.  Commissioners who did not favor including the Established Large Site Overlay supported having the height and FAR standards in Chapter 4, Table 4.2 apply to all Downtown projects.  These Commissioners expressed concern that District height limits should not be exceeded and authorizing greater height and FAR in the Plan would signal that increased height is acceptable.  There was a desire to ensure that the appropriate form in Downtown is established first through the DCP’s base standards and not influenced by community benefits and project amenities.  These Commissioners agreed that applicants for each project should submit Specific Plan Amendments for review on a project-by-project basis.  Similarly, the Commission rejected a selection of process options that would have required voter approval or a supermajority of Council to effect changes to the adopted DCP.  The Commission was nearly unanimous (6-1 straw vote) in the belief that Council authority is sufficient to render decisions related to Plan amendments, and that the referendum process established in State law provides appropriate opportunities for voters to challenge Council’s legislative actions.  Access and Mobility The Planning Commission has actively provided feedback on the Access and Mobility chapter specific actions and overall approach. Following discussion with the Commission, the Plan now calls for preparing for emerging technologies that serves the community’s vision, strengthens the plans consistency with Vision Zero, and updates parking policies that the Commission has since suggested amending. The Commission strongly communicated a desire to not only be forward-thinking but aggressive with implementation, as reflected in the errata sheet recommended by the Commission.  The DCP addresses steps to ensure how technology can best be used to make Downtown’s existing transportation network work better for people. The Plan includes an approach to making travel information easier to access through real-time information for transit service, bike share availability, travel times, and parking availability. A methodological use of information on parking and travel patterns can also be used to plan for and manage peak travel periods, which allow for having the right amount of people working at the right times to assist travelers and deployment of the most effective changes needed during peak travel periods.  Technology is increasing the viability of shared rides, microtransit or privately owned transit, autonomous vehicles, and widespread acceptance of electric vehicles. The DCP provides direction on how technology can be integrated with transportation in Downtown and how Santa Monica can participate in guiding the development of these technologies in the region.  Parking Climate change, traffic congestion, and changing usage patterns necessitate shifting parking policies. The Commission has affirmed the right-sizing and right-placing by having a discreet amount of new parking primarily on the periphery of Downtown. There has also been support for studying and then supporting private parking availability for the public.  Parking related changes suggested to Council by the Planning Commission include: ·  Creating a new parking district in the Zoning Ordinance specifically for the Downtown that supports preservation of buildings through greater flexibility when a use changes. The DCP parking requirements recommend a universal parking rate of 1 space per 500 square feet for all retail and restaurant uses under 5,000 square feet, parking rates are similarly adjusted for residential units. (Zoning Ordinance Amendments) ·  Enabling the phased development of up to 800 public parking spaces in peripheral locations to address future demand without incentivizing additional vehicle trips downtown (Action AM3.6C) ·  Pursuing the elimination of 600 public parking spaces within the Bayside Conservation District within 10 years of adoption of the plan. (New AM3.6 Action) ·  Re-evaluating private parking requirements after 1,500 new parking spaces have been entitled (Action AM3.5G) ·  Establishing demand-sensitive variable parking pricing, time-limits and marketing. (AM3.6A) ·  Encouraging use of convenient parking for short-term use through pricing and time restrictions, including installation of meters on 6 th and 7 th Streets. (new AM3.6B) ·  Completing the expansion of the Parking In-Lieu Fee program to include all properties in the DCP boundaries by 2019. (Action AM4.5F) ·  Requiring that new public parking must be built entirely outside of the Bayside Conservation District, including on projects that may overlap with that district, such as the city-owned 4 th /5 th /Arizona site (new AM3.6 action)  The Planning Commission also made a number of recommendations in regards to bicycling, walking and resident access including aggressive implementation timelines. Specific recommendations include: ·  Creation of protected bike facilities on Ocean Avenue, 2ne Street, and Broadway (Action AM4.3B) ·  Minimizing the closure of bike and pedestrian facilities due to construction and providing clear and direct alternates when closure is necessary. (Actions AM1.2E and AM1.2F) ·  Pursuing the creation of a Santa Monica resident transportation pass or credit usable for select mobility services and parking access Downtown, especially during off-peak periods. (Action 4.1K)  A.  SPOTLIGHT ISSUES FOR COUNCIL CONSIDERATION This section of the report identifies several “spotlight” issues for Council consideration that were raised in the course of the Planning Commission’s deliberations on the DCP. The DCP provides for ample housing production over the life of the Plan through a variety of process and technical incentives that are designed to steer development towards the creation of new residential units.  These incentives include a .5 FAR bonus for housing projects over their commercial counterparts, as well as some additional height in the transition zones. Coupled with project requirements for new Affordable Housing, the DCP housing production incentives create the condition to achieve the forecasted minimum of 2,500 new units within the next 15 years.  The possibility for additional square footage for housing exists within the volume of development contemplated in the Plan’s EIR, potentially adding up to roughly 3,100 new units if less commercial, medical or institutional uses are proposed than originally forecasted.  Recent criticism of the DCP’s housing approach has raised the specter of the nationwide housing crisis with many proponents demanding higher heights and densities than currently proposed or even studied in the EIR.  Public testimony and correspondence point to a sentiment that Santa Monica must do more to provide housing to those in need, even though the City is well on track to achieve or surpass its Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) number given by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), and that Downtown has the highest allowable FARs in the entire City.  During the Planning Commission hearings, the Commission recommended several process and technical incentive changes that fast-track housing projects Downtown, such as an Administrative Approval process for typical two-lot projects that typically result in projects of approximately 5-6 stories and 60 units.  The Commission also recommended a more permissive administrative threshold for 100% Affordable Housing projects and height and FAR increases for 100% Affordable Housing in the Neighborhood Village District.  For Council Consideration : Should the Council wish to go beyond the DCP’s recommended “housing-first” strategy, the following options are presented for consideration: Option 1 : Increase process thresholds by which more housing projects would qualify for streamlined entitlements. Option 2 : Further reduction in height and FAR for commercial projects (e.g. 10’ and 0.5 FAR). Option 3 : Require all projects on sites of greater than 15,000 square feet to have at least 50% of the floor area be residential uses, except for hotels, movie theaters, auto dealers, public infrastructure, and the Third Street Promenade. Option 4 : Increasing the height and FAR standards, subject to additional environmental evaluation  Table of Supporting and Opposing Arguments for Each Policy Alternative   1 ·  Provides significant time incentives for developers to seek housing ·  Creates certainty for community and developer ·  Perception of reduction in opportunities for public participation 2 ·  Would clearly establish preference for housing projects by further reducing height and FAR for commercial projects ·  Overall reduction in height and FAR for commercial projects was done for neighborhood transitions but implementing this strategy in Downtown core could have unintended consequence of affecting Downtown economic vitality 3 ·  Guarantees that any larger project would be required to have 50% residential use, prohibiting strictly office and retail projects (exempting hotels, movie theaters, auto dealers, public infrastructure, and buildings on the Third Street Promenade. ·  Blanket standard that prescribes land use mix and reduces flexibility in land use decisions ·  Proscriptive approach instead of providing incentives 4 ·  Could result in potentially more than 2,500 new housing units if FAR standards are increased ·  Would not result in substantially more housing units ·  Inconsistent with urban design strategy proposed in DCP and widely discussed and endorsed by the community  Staff Recommendation Staff recommends further process incentives be considered as described in Option 1, as they would provide clear project requirements with predictable timelines established in DCP.  The Planning Commission recommended that an Administrative Approval process would be appropriate for projects on sites no greater than 15,000 square feet.  The Commission also recommended that a Development Review Permit would be appropriate for Tier 3 projects no greater than 90,000 square feet in the Transit Adjacent District.  This was intended to allow typical housing projects that are similar in size and scale to housing projects that already exist in the Downtown leaving larger projects subject to Planning Commission review.  As a further process incentive, Council could establish a higher threshold for Administrative Approvals (AA) that would provide predictability to applicants with respect to number of housing units authorized, amount of affordable housing units required, affordability level of units, open space requirements, and certainty in applicable development standards.  The Administrative Approval (AA) process provides certainty that the project will be approved if it meets all of the DCP’s project requirements.  This class of housing projects would be required to obtain a recommendation from the ARB before the AA could be approved and would still need to obtain final approval on the project design from the ARB.  This process is similar to the procedural incentives that were formerly in place for Downtown in the 1990s that resulted in the production of approximately 2,500 housing units over the course of three decades. The significant difference is the DCP has a variety of development standards in place that are intended to ensure that projects not only complement Downtown’s existing character but also contribute to the implementation of Downtown as a vibrant, walkable place that welcomes a diverse population of all income levels. The Planning Commission’s narrow recommendation to remove the Established Large Site Overlay from the DCP points to the divergence of opinions surrounding tall buildings in Downtown Santa Monica.  Outreach to the community on this subject was balanced at opposite ends, with roughly 50% in favor and another 50% opposed.  Those in favor of the Overlay, which would allow three projects to propose building heights up to 130’ within an established planning framework, argued that the potential benefits for open space, historic preservation, and mobility outweighed potential negative impacts associated with shade/shadow and scale.  Those opposed to the Overlay expressed concern that Santa Monica’s identity as a low-scale coastal community would be compromised by tall buildings, and further – that the DCP’s standards should reflect a level playing field for all development, and not single out a few exceptions.  For Council Consideration : Should the DCP include the Established Large Site Overlay, which would authorize consideration of height up to 130 feet and additional FAR on three sites in Downtown?  Staff Recommendation on Height for Established Large Sites The concept of the Established Large Site Overlay presented in the draft DCP seeks to establish clear expectations in terms of maximum height, appropriate FAR, and open space requirements for three sites in Downtown.  The proposal also establishes a rigorous review process that requires a development agreement application and includes additional environmental review and a comprehensive application that demonstrates how the project meets DCP priorities.  No Specific Plan Amendment would be required.  As legislative actions, development agreements would be subject to the voter approval process already established in State law.  Staff believes that there are site-specific reasons why allowing for additional height would lead to superior outcomes for future development on these sites.  Staff also believes that imposing a clear maximum height for future projects on those sites provides clarity and coherence to protect the integrity of the overall plan that would be absent if property owners/developers could seek consideration for essentially unlimited heights for projects on those sites – or could seek additional heights on sites where positive trade-offs simply do not apply.  Allowing the projects to move forward with the 130’ height would allow flexibility for more ground level public space, preservation of historic buildings and features (currently on two of the three sites) and the opportunity for more distinctive and functional architectural massing, modulation and design.  Options for Established Large Site Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Each of the Established Large Sites have individual FAR parameters, which dictate the mass and scale of the projects. While the proposed height of these projects has been the focus of discussions, the projects’ FARs also have the potential to directly influence the project and community benefits that could be achieved on these three sites. Should Council seek options for exploring revised FARs for these sites, staff proposes three options for consideration: Option 1: Maintain the DCP’s existing individual FAR parameters for the Established Large Sites, which were originally presented in the 2014 version of the DCP, and in all subsequent drafts leading up to the final DCP. Were this option to be adopted, it would reflect the original development parameters that have been consistently discussed throughout the multi-year public process of creating the DCP and the proposals that have been submitted to the City by the applicants. Option 2: Modify the DCP’s FAR parameters such that all three Established Large Sites would be subject to a universal 3.0 FAR, which represents an average of the development potential across all three sites provided by the DCP’s base development standards for each Zoning District. Were this option to be adopted, it would reduce development potential for two of the three sites and ensure that the development of all three Established Large Sites would not exceed the theoretical development potential of the total land area of all three sites were these parcels developed in a series of typical two- or three-lot projects as opposed to the larger block-level projects that have been proposed. Option 3: Modify the DCP’s FAR parameters such that the FAR for each of the three sites would be limited to the maximum FAR established for each Zoning District averaged across the whole site.  Were this option to be adopted, it would reduce development potential for two of the three sites, which in turn may limit certain aspects of the proposed projects.  Comparison between three FAR options for the Established Large Sites        1133 Ocean Avenue 191,664 sf FAR=3.0  FAR=3.0     FAR: 2.75 (OT) [AVG = 2.75 FAR]  191,664 x 2.75 = 527,076 sf  101 Santa Monica Blvd 82,500 sf FAR=4.0   FAR=3.0       FAR: 3.5 (BC) Split Zone 2.75(OT) [AVG = 3.0 FAR]  31,010 x 3.5 = 108,535 sf 51,490 x 2.75 = 141,598 sf  4 th /5 th and Arizona 112,000 sf FAR=3.5   FAR=3.0       FAR: 3.5 (BC) Split Zone 3.25 (NV) [AVG = 3.4 FAR]  56,000 x 3.5 = 196,000 sf 56,000 x 3.25 = 182,000 sf  If the Established Large Site Overlay is not included in the DCP, the three sites would be required to comply with the height and FAR standards established in the development standards table.  Where there are split zones, the separate development standards for the portion of the property within each applicable zoning district would apply.  As a result, applicants would need to submit Specific Plan Amendments for each individual project. Because the DCP takes a “housing-first” approach, commercial office uses in Downtown’s active and transitional areas are limited predominantly to upper floors or at the rear of a project.  The one area of the Downtown where commercial offices are permitted at the ground floor is in the Neighborhood Village District, where many existing ground floor offices, such as the Chamber of Commerce, are currently located.  At its final hearing on the DCP, the Planning Commission voted to recommend that commercial office in the Neighborhood Village be limited to upper floors or at the rear of a project. Staff is concerned that this recommendation will render many existing offices non-conforming.  Additionally, staff is concerned that there is not enough retail demand to justify the elimination of ground floor office (which includes “walk-in clientele”), and could have the unwelcome effect of producing vacant storefronts.  For Council Consideration : Should the Planning Commission’s recommendation to eliminate all ground floor office from the Plan be adopted? If not, the following option is recommended by staff:  Staff Recommendation Based on an existing land use survey of the Neighborhood Village District, offices currently make up approximately 45% of the ground floor street frontage.  The Planning Commission’s recommendation would make all of these ground floor uses non-conforming and replace them with potentially residential or retail uses as change occurs.  A 2015 Downtown market outlook report that was used as a point of comparison for the Buildout Analysis demonstrated limits to the amount of retail space that could be feasibly supported in the DCP boundaries.  The land use strategy in the DCP establishes the Neighborhood Village District as an area of mixed activity where non-active uses such as residential and office uses could be allowed on the ground floor in mid-block locations only.  More active retail and restaurant spaces are strategically targeted for corner locations.  The existing retail spaces in these mid-block locations have historically been difficult to lease and the ground floor non-active uses would likely have better compatibility with the residential uses that are anticipated in the district.  B.  AMENDMENTS TO RELATED DOCUMENTS Various associated amendments to the Land Use and Circulation Element, Civic Center Specific Plan, and Zoning Ordinance are necessary to implement the goals and policies of the draft DCP.  Upon receiving direction from Council’s deliberations on the Plan, staff anticipates bringing these associated resolutions and ordinances to Council for formal action on July 25, 2017.  LUCE Amendment The LUCE is proposed to be amended to reflect the elimination of Tier 3 on Lincoln Boulevard and within the Wilshire Transition district.  CCSP Amendment The CCSP is proposed to be amended to remove the Colorado Avenue Special Use District.  This change is necessary to eliminate overlap and the potential for conflicting regulations between the DCP and CCSP boundaries.  Zoning Ordinance Amendments The DCP will be incorporated by reference into the Zoning Ordinance.  Where there is a conflict between the Zoning Ordinance and DCP, the DCP shall prevail.  Where the DCP is silent, the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance shall apply.  There are also a number of zoning ordinance amendments that are associated with the DCP that are being proposed to complement the standards of the draft DCP.  These include the following:  ·  Fence, Wall, Hedge height limits – establish fence, wall and hedge standards within the Downtown Community Plan area ·  Demolition Requirements – requires that demolition application screening and 75-day period are cleared before an application may be accepted for filing ·  Parking o  Establish parking maximums o  New parking requirements o  Incorporate parking in-lieu fee ·  Outdoor dining standards – clarify the name of the outdoor dining standards and clarify that the City Manager may promulgate guidelines necessary to implement outdoor dining requirements  Associated with the above Zoning Ordinance amendments are anticipated amendments to Division 6 (Land Use and Zoning Related Provisions) and Article 8 (Building Regulations).  These include a 100% transportation allowance for nonresidential projects and nonresidential components of mixed-use projects based upon Downtown’s higher average vehicle ridership (AVR) target of 2.2 and voter approval procedures for development agreements, if applicable.  An amendment to SMMC Section 8.08.060 is proposed to extend the expiration time limits for demolition applications to accommodate the new demolition review procedures.  These proposed amendments are attached to this staff report to inform Council’s consideration of the DCP. 	\N	2

10	Construction Contract for the Marine Park Irrigation Retrofit Project	Public Works, Civil Engineering	In accordance with the Sustainable City plan, t he City of Santa Monica has a 100 percent water supply self-sufficiency goal by the year 2020  in which a major component of the plan includes reduction in overall water demand .  The Marine Park Irrigation Retrofit Project (Project) would assist in achieving that goal by reducing overall water demand through usage of alternat ive water supply methods for irrigation needs at Marine Park . The project aims to conserve nearly 3.5 million gallons of potable water per year which would assist the City in reaching the overall water supply self-sufficiency goal through water conservation .  The Marine Park Irrigation Retrofit Project (Project) includes the installation of approximately 5,000 linear feet of treated urban runoff (TUR) water pipeline from a 2.75-million-gallon reservoir located beneath Penmar Park in the City of Los Angeles  into a daily holding tank at Marine Park. The tank would  provide storage for the TUR, and a pump system would deliver water from the tank to the irrigation system at Marine Park. The Project would  reduce the demand for imported water by utilizing treated wet-weather (stormwater) and dry-weather (non-stormwater) runoff for irrigation purposes.  S taff recommends Sully-Miller Contracting Co.  for the construction of the Project in an amount not to exceed $ $2,271,610 (including a 1 0 % contingency). Staff recommends Arcadis US, Inc. to provide construction management and inspection services in an amount not to exceed $245,410 (including a 10% contingency).  The Marine Park Project is funded by the Clean Beaches and Ocean Parcel Tax (Measure V) and Proposition 84 through the California Depa rtment of Water Resources (DWR).  Per the grant requirements of Prop osition 84, the C ity is required to adopt a Labor Compliance program. 	C urrently, the City’s groundwater treatment facilities supply up to 75  percent of the City’s water needs while the other 25  percent of the water demand is outsourced through the Metropolitan Water District (MWD) .  The Marine Park Project is funded by the Clean Beaches and Ocean Parcel Tax (Measure V) and Proposition 84 through the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), and is considered an Integrated Regional Water Management (IRWM) Project which improves water reliability, protects and improves water quality, and improves local water security by reducing dependence on imported water. The Proposition 84 grant is funding approximately forty percent of the project.   The Los Angeles County Flood Control District and the DWR have entered into a grant agreement to provide funding assistance to public agencies in Los Angeles County to implement various IRWM projects, including the City of Santa Monica’s Marine Park project and the City of Los Angeles’ Penmar Water Quality Improvement and Runoff Reuse Project (Penmar Project).  The Penmar Project consists of two phases.  Phase I is complete and diverts urban runoff from the cities of Santa Monica and Los Angeles into a 2.75-million-gallon reservoir (runoff capture facility) that was constructed beneath Penmar Park in the City of Los Angeles .  Phase II of the Penmar project is currently in construction and consists of installing the systems required to treat the captured stormwater  and distribute it to  three primary stakeholders.  Treated storm water would be used to irrigate Penmar Golf Course (City of Los Angeles), Penmar Park (City of Los Angeles), and Marine Park (City of Santa Monica). Phase II includes the installation of an urban runoff treatment system, as well as other required infrastructure and components that will integrate the treatment system into the existing irrigation treatment systems at the three locations.  Memorandum of Agreement Pursuant to the terms of the Grant Agreement, the City of Santa Monica and City of Los Angeles are required to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for purposes of supplying TUR from the City of Los Angeles runoff capture facility to the City of Santa Monica’s Marine Park. The primary terms of the agreement include: yearly term of the agreement, project implementation roles, project operation and maintenance, cost for TUR use, available supply of TUR, and pump operation for the distribution of TUR. Currently, the MOA is under review at the City of Los Angeles.  The City of Los Angeles estimates the MOA will be executed by March 9, 2017.  Awarding the construction contract, and subsequently commencing construction, prior to MOA execution places the City at risk of building the planned facilities without a guaranteed supply of TUR or a legally binding TUR rate.  However, deferring the construction award, and construction, until after MOA execution, places the City at risk of missing the Prop 84 grant project completion deadline of December 31, 2017.  In order to help alleviate the prior risk, the City of Los Angeles provided the City of Santa Monica with a Letter of Intent (LOI) (Attachment C ) detailing the agreed upon terms of $2.85 per hundred cubic feet that the City of Santa Monica would  have to pay for receiving the treated water from the Penmar Project .  This equates to 80 percent  of the City’s potable water rates.  Labor Compliance Program Proposition 84 (Safe Drinking Water, Water Quality and Supply, Flood Control, River and Coastal Protection Bond Act of 2006) requires that awarding bodies have an approved Labor Compliance Program (LCP).  LCPs are entities which are approved by the Director of Industrial Relations to monitor and enforce compliance with state prevailing wage laws on public works projects.  An LCP is required to inform contractors about their prevailing wage obligations, monitor compliance by obtaining and reviewing certified payrolls reports, investigating complaints and other suspected violations and take appropriate enforcement action when violations are found.  In order to receive Proposition 84 grant funds, the City has to have an approved LCP enforcement manual.  T o assist with prevailing wage compliance, the City has contracted with Gafcon to serve as the labor compliance consultant under this Labor Compliance P rogram. A resolution must be adopted by City Council prior to the City submitting its LCP application to the State (Attachment A) . As part of its scope of work, Gafcon drafted a LCP Manual (Attachment B), which documents the City’s implementation of its proposed LCP. If approved by Council, the LCP Manual will need to be reviewed by the State Department of Industrial Relations as part of its approval of the City’s proposed LCP. 	 The Project would  convey treated urban runoff produced by the Penmar Project Phase II via pressure main piping from the 2.75-million-gallon reservoir constructed as part of  Penmar Project Phase I  to a 25,000 gallon daily holding tank located at Marine Park.  The new below ground holding tank is sized to provide peak daily irrigation needs to the park during dry summer months.  A newly designed above ground pump station skid system would supply treated urban runoff to the existing irrigation system.  Marine Park uses approximately 3.5 million gallons, equivalent to four Olympic sized swimming pools of potable water , each year, with nearly all of the usage to irrigation. From recent estimation the project would supply the entire 3.5 million gallons/year of water usage for irrigation via treated urban water runoff from the Penmar Project, resulting in potable water savings.  The Marine Park Irrigation Retrofit Project is included in the City of Santa Monica’s Measure V 5-year Capital Improvement Plan and is consistent with the type of projects identified by the Santa Monica Bay Beaches Bacterial TMDL Implementation Plan. Rather than using the estimated annual 3.5 million gallons of potable water, this project effectively functions as a water saving measure by using treated non-potable water to irrigate landscape.  This project is unique because of the joint usage between Santa Monica and Los Angeles cities for the treatment and reuse of non-potable water. Construction is anticipated to begin in April 2017 and be completed by December 2017.  Contractor Selection - Construction On November 10, 2016, the City published Notices Inviting Bids for construction services for the Marine Park Irrigation Retrofit Project. The bid was posted on the City’s online bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provision s . A total of 1982 vendors were notified and 63 vendors downloaded the bid. Five  bids were received and publicly opened on December 12, 2016.  Bid results are as follows: Base Bid Amount  Blois Construction, Inc (withdrawn) $1,318,850.00 $246,000.00 $1,564,850.00 Sully-Miller Contracting Co. $1,920,300.00 $144,800.00 $2,065,100.00 Bosco Constructors, Inc. $2,142,976.00 $98,500.00 $2,241,476.00 J.R. Filanc, Inc. $2,187,900.00 $255,000.00 $2,442,900.00 PPC Construction, Inc. $2,281,680.00 $246,700.00 $2,528,380.00 Engineer’s Estimate $ 1,885,114.00 $ 166,400.00 $2, 051,514.00  On December 9, 2016,  staff received a formal letter from Blois Construction Inc., requesting that its bid be withdrawn due to a clerical error.  The City Attorney reviewed the applicable provisions in Public Contract Code Section 5103 , and based on that review advised staff to return the bid bond submitted by Blois Construction Inc.  The contractor ’s estimate and bid breakdowns were reviewed in detail for validation. It was found that the original contractor’s estimate did not include the correct quantity calculations for the paving operations on the project. After spending considerable time and effort to determine if the contractor could overcome these omissions , the contractor concluded that the substantially reduced price would not allow them to provide the quality needed on this project forcing them to withdraw its bid .  Bids were evaluated based on criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including pricing, understanding of the project scope, direct experience with similar projects, approach to the work, technical competence, qualifications of the proposed staff, and the ability to meet the project schedule.  Staff contacted reference agencies listed by the recommended contractor to ascertain past performance on similar projects, including City of Lomita , City of La Habra, City of Fontana, and City of Moreno Valley. Staff also verified with the Contractors State License Board that Sully-Miller Contracting Co.  and its subcontractors’ licenses are current, active, and in good standing. Based on these criteria, Sully-Miller Contracting Co., is recommended as the best bidder for construction services of the Marine Park Irrigation Retrofit.  Consultant Selection - Construction Management On September 22, 2015 , the City issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for construction management and inspection services for upcoming construction projects on the City’s online bidding website.  A total of 1674 venders were notified and 124 vendors downloaded the RFQ. The City received 25 proposals. Responses to the RFQ were reviewed by a selection panel of staff from the Public Works Department. Evaluation was based on the selection criteria set forth in SMMC Section 2.24. 0 73 , with specific review of the following:  technical competence, staffing capability, project approach, past performance, dispute resolution, quality control, cost control, management services, customer service, and the ability to meet required time frames. The top four firms ( Anderson-Penna, Arcadis, CWE, and GK Associates) were invited to participate in the Request for Proposal (RFP) phase in June 2016. Based on the selection criteria set forth in SMMC 2.24.073, Arcadis US, Inc. is recommended as the best qualified firm to provide construction management and inspection services based on its qualifications and its directly related experience providing similar services for municipal agencies. Arcadis US, In c . has extensive knowledge and experience on numerous construction projects in the cities of Los Angeles, Coachella, Highland, South Pasadena, Santa Monica , and Irvine. Services provided by Arcadis US, Inc. would include construction management services, continuous inspection of the contractor’s work, verification and management of field changes and unforeseen conditions, monitoring and mitigation of impacts as a result of the construction activities, attendance at the construction  contractor’s safety meeting s , attendance at  periodic progress meetings, recordkeeping of all necessary inspection documentation relevant to the work performed during construction, and public outreach.  Public Outreach Public outreach during construction of this P roject would be provided by the City and by the City’s construction management consultant as part of the construction management effort.  Public outreach would include notifications distributed to adjacent properties and the surrounding community regarding  the scope of the P roject, and schedule periodic updates on the City’s “Know Before You Go” (aka KBUG) website and Monday editions of the Santa Monica Daily Press.  Notifications would  also be posted on social media and in local newspapers.  Properties impacted by the P roject would  receive two construction notices.  The first general notice would be hand delivered to properties adjacent to the proposed Project  two weeks prior to the start of construction.  A second two-day notice would be subsequently hand-delivered to each adjacent property with detailed information regarding the planned construction activity, potential impacts, and contact information.   The notices would be prepared by Public Works staff and distributed by the construction management consultant . A project specific outreach campaign, including one-on-one coordination with: 1) City of Los Angeles’ Penmar Park/Golf Course, 2) Marine Park and 3) Growing Place day care at the Marine Park Campus would commence prior to start of construction and continue through completion of the P roject .  Street Parking along Dewey Street The new treated urban runoff pipe alignment would be just south of the centerline of Dewey Street.  Currently, parking is on the north side of Dewey Street only. During construction, some parking on the north side would be impacted, however, residents would continue to have unimpeded access to their properties, and after each working day, all impacted parking would be restored. Environmental Exemption In 2012, a Notice of CEQA Exemption was submitted and subsequently approved by the State Clearinghouse with a Categorical Exemption per State Guide section 15301(b) and 15061(b)(3) (Attachment D ). Section 15301(b) allows for minor alterations to existing publicly-owned structures, including utilities. Section 15061(b)  (3) states that provisions of CEQA only apply to those projects which have the potential to cause a significant adverse environmental impact. The City determined that the proposed project will not have a significant adverse impact on the environment, therefore, this project is exempt from CEQA requirements.  	\N	3
11	Appeal 16ENT-0068 of the Planning Commission’s Approval of Variance 15ENT-0304 to Amend a Previously Approved Variance (03VAR-014) for a 126 Square-Foot, Third Floor Balcony Along the Rear Building Elevation of an Existing Single-family Residence Located at 144 Fraser Avenue	Planning and Community Development	The owner of 144 Fra s er Avenue wishes to extend a balcony on the top floor of the property. While appearing to be a two story home from the street, s pecial circumstances require this home be defined as a three story home, requiring the owner receive approval on the variance from the Planning Commission.  On May 11, 2016, the Planning Commission approved Variance 15ENT-0304 to increase the size of the existing third floor balcony along the rear building elevation of an existing single family home at 144 Fra s er .   The Planning Commission approval authorized a 126 square - foot third floor balcony that extends to the existing rear edge of the building and is setback three feet from the existing side elevation of the building.  The Appellant, Maud Orwitz , filed an appeal of the Planning Commission’s approval on May 12, 2016.  The appellant requests that City Council overturn the Planning Commission’s approval of Variance 15ENT-0304 , stating that the findings cannot be made or justified, and conditions of approval to expand the existing third floor balcony do not sufficiently mitigate the impacts to the adjacent neighbors ’ privacy .  This report summarizes the Planning Commission’s action, the points of each appeal provided by the appellant, and staff’s analysis.  This report concludes with a recommendation from staff to uphold the Variance approval based upon the findings and subject to the conditions adopted by the Planning Commission on May 11, 2016. 	Existing Conditions and Setting The subject property is a 2,820-square foot parcel measuring 30-feet wide by 94-feet deep.  It is located on the south side of Fraser Avenue, between Neilson Way and Barnard Way.  The parcel slopes downward from the front property line toward the rear property line and has an elevation difference of approximately 4.25-feet from front to rear.  The site is improved with a single-family residence.  Although it appears to be a two-story residence when viewed from the street, the structure is technically a three-story structure because the finished elevation of the raised first floor is more than three feet above the site’s average natural grade level.  As a result, the basement level beneath the first floor is considered the first story as defined by Section 9.52.020.0230 of the Zoning Ordinance.  Consequently, the first floor is defined as the second story and the second floor is defined as the third story.  Surrounding land uses consist of a mix of one- and two-story single-family residences in the R2 Beach Overlay Zoning district. Figure 1: Photo of Existing Residence  The relevant permit history for the site is described below.  2003 Original Variance Request On October 14, 2003, the Zoning Administrator considered a Variance request for a 140 square foot addition with a 25-foot rear yard setback and a 219 square foot balcony on the third story of the existing single-family residence.  Due to the site’s sloping characteristics, the proposed addition was considered a third story to the structure, pursuant to the standards of the Zoning Ordinance, where a maximum allowable height of two stories and 30 feet are permitted.   Beyond the technical aspect of the addition being defined as a third story, the existing structure and the proposed addition were in compliance with all the development standards of the Zoning Ordinance including being within the maximum building envelope, a maximum allowable building height of 30 feet, a minimum rear setback of 15 feet, and a maximum lot coverage of 50%.  Ultimately, the Zoning Administrator determined that the proposed third floor addition and balcony had the potential to adversely impact the privacy of adjacent properties.  The Zoning Administrator found that while the balcony was intended for outdoor use, the proposed size and location of the balcony had the potential to encourage significant outdoor activity on a narrow parcel and at an elevated location.   As a result, the Zoning Administrator approved Variance 03VAR-014 for a technical third story addition with a 25-foot rear setback.  The decision also included a condition of approval that no balcony shall be permitted on the third floor le v el.  The Zoning Administrator determination prohibiting a third floor balcony was appealed by the property owner. 2004 Appeal of Variance to Planning Commission On February 8, 2004, the Planning Commission considered Appeal 03APP-018.  The minutes of this Planning Commission meeting are included as Attachment F to this staff report.  The Planning Commission determined that the proposed design of the 219 square foot third floor balcony had the potential to impact the privacy of adjacent properties in that it would permit outdoor activity that offered considerable visual access to adjacent private yards.  Therefore, the Planning Commission upheld the Zoning Administrator’s decision to approve the Variance request with modifications to the project design.  Specifically, the Zoning Administrator condition of approval prohibiting a third floor balcony was removed, and the following conditions of approval Nos. 6-8 were added to maintain the 25-foot rear setback, as proposed in the applicant’s design, and to allow a modest balcony to project beyond the third floor addition that was inset into the center of the building’s rear elevation.   03APP-018  Conditions of Approval:    The Planning Commission determined that the revised balcony design better addressed privacy concerns generated by the layout of the balcony, and concerns relative to significant outdoor activity had been reduced to acceptable levels due to the width, depth, and area of the balcony.  Due to the small size of the balcony, the Planning Commission concluded that it no longer had a natural propensity towards group activities that may generate higher noise levels and pulling the balcony location farther back from the rear and side property lines reduced views into adjacent parcels.  The conditions of approval establish a maximum balcony size of 24 square feet, with a 22-foot rear setback and 11-foot side setbacks on a 30-foot wide property. The existing balcony is shown in Figure 2 below. Figure 2: Photo of Existing Balcony (24 SF) Project Description On September 10, 2015, the applicant filed Variance 15ENT-0304 requesting to remove the conditions of approval limiting the size and location of balcony to allow an 8’-00” x 21’-09” (175SF) balcony that is setback 17 feet from the rear property line, and more than 4 feet from both the north and south side property lines, respectively, as shown in Figure 3 below.  Figure 3: Requested Third Floor Balcony Expansion  May 11, 2016:  15ENT-0304: The Planning Commission approved the Variance request to allow for a 126 square foot third floor balcony that extends to the existing rear edge of the building and is setback 3 feet from the existing side elevations of the building, superseding Condition Nos. 7 and 8 of the previously approved Variance 03-014 as included in the Statement of Official Action (Attachment C). 2016 Planning Commission Action On May 11, 2016, the Planning Commission reviewed and approved Variance 15ENT-030 with conditions and modifications to the applicant’s proposal.  The Commission’s discussion focused on the size and location of the existing balcony in comparison to surrounding properties and addressing privacy concerns raised by adjacent neighbors. As discussed, Conditions Nos. 7 and 8 of 03VAR-014 places location limitations on the existing balcony and limited its size to a maximum of 24 square feet.  The applicant’s proposed Variance amendment requested that these conditions be eliminated. The Commission found that in order to allow for reasonable outdoor space comparable to adjacent neighbors and to mitigate privacy impacts to adjacent neighbors, a 126 square-foot, third-floor balcony would be appropriate.  The Commission’s decision amended and superseded the conditions of previously approved Variance 03-014. The Commission’s approval limiting the size and location of the balcony to allow an 8’-00” x 15’-9” (126SF) that extends to the existing rear edge of the building (17 feet from the rear property line) and is set back 3 feet from the existing side edges of the building.  The Commission’s approval is illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 4:  Planning Commission’s Approved Third Floor Balcony Expansion 	 Pursuant to SMMC Section 9.42.020, Variances may be granted with respect to development standards by the City Council, on appeal.  In addition to the required findings for a Variance, t he following issues should be considered by the City Council in its de novo review of the proposed project:  ·  Whether there are special circumstances or exceptional characteristics applicable to the property involved, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, or to the intended use or development of the property that do not apply to other properties in the vicinity under an identical zoning classification. ·  Whether the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, not including economic difficulties or economic hardships. ·  Whether the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in unreasonable deprivation of the use or enjoyment of the property. Specifically, what would be the nature of the impact on the property owner should the V ariance be denied, and whether there are alternatives that would not require the V ariance.   In this case, there are special circumstances and unnecessary hardships that are depriving the owner the reasonable use of the property when compared to other similar properties in the neighborhood.  Special Circumstances or Exceptional Characteristics This finding is specific to the subject property having a special circumstance or exceptional characteristic that does not apply to other properties in the vicinity with the same zoning classification.  Fundamentally, this finding is based on whether there are unique physical disparities between properties under identical zoning classifications within the area, and whether there are special conditions that are different from the conditions that affect other nearby properties within the same district.  T he subject parcel is a substandard lot in terms of width, depth, and size.  The site measures 30’ wide by 94’ deep ( 2,820SF) where a standard lot in this neighborhood is 50’ wide by 100’ deep (5,000SF).  The property’s existing conditions with respect to parcel slope result in the building’s practical first floor to be considered a second floor and likewise, the second floor to be considered a third floor level, which creates a special circumstance with respect to how building design on the site relates to the applicability of the Zoning Ordinance.  As shown in Figure 5 , the proposed balcony on the technical 3 rd floor is less impactful than a code compliant roof deck over a hypothetical 2-story project.  If not for the slope of the parcel, this would be a two-story single-family residence with a balcony at the rear that is fully compliant with the development standards of the Zoning Ordinance.  The height of the proposed balcony addition and views into neighboring properties are considerably less than a roof deck that could be constructed by right on the property pursuant to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.  Given the existing restrictions, pursuant to the conditions of approval for 13VAR-014 and 03APP-018, and the development standards of the Zoning Ordinance, the roof of the existing structure could be modified to accommodate a roof deck addition to the existing single-family structure without any discretionary approval other than review by the Architectural Review Board. Figure 5 : Balcony/Roof Deck Comparison Practical Difficulties or Unnecessary Hardships Th is finding relates to practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, not including economic hardships that may result from the application of development standar ds.  An unnecessary hardship would be an uncharacteristic feature to a particular property and not general in nature. The determinations for 03VAR-014 and 03APP-018 for the master bedroom addition took into account the sloping characteristic of the site and its relationship to the proposed addition and its physical surroundings as part of the approvals; however, the conditions of approval imposed on the project are unnecessarily more restrictive than the minimum requirements of the Zoning Ordinance to the extent where reasonable enjoyment of the property is deprived.  In the R2 (Multi-Unit Residential) Beach Overlay zoning district a minimum 15-foot rear setback is required.  Balconies are permitted to project a maximum of four feet into the required rear setback (i.e. 11-foot rear setback for balcony). The decisions made by the Zoning Administrator, and the Planning Commission upon appeal, established an increased rear setback of 25 feet with a maximum balcony projection of three feet on the substandard lot.  The setback restrictions were imposed due to concerns raised about privacy and neig hborhood compatibility; however, t here are a number of other properties in the neighborhood with authorized third story additions that were afforded the opportunity of roof decks and rear balconies that are larger in size and elevated above ground level to enhance the enjoyment of the properties and their proximity to the be ach, as demonstrated in Figure 6 below.  Figure 6 : Neighborhood Map of Third-Story Variances and Upper Floor Balconies  Unreasonable Deprivation or the Use or Enjoyment of the Property This finding relates to unreasonable deprivation of the use or enjoyment of the property that may result from the application of development standards, particularly to proposed balcony.  This finding is based on whether requiring the applicant to comply with the Zoning Ordinance prevents the applicant from utilizing the property in substantially the same manner that neighboring properties are or could be utilized.  The City Council should assess whether the Variance gives the applicant greater rights than would be available to surrounding neighbors. To date, the City has granted seven third story variances, including the subject site, within an approximate 300-foot radius of the subject property , all of wh ich are listed below in Figure 7 and highlighted in Figure 6 above.  All of these properties have similar site conditions as the subject property in terms of lot size, configuration and grade.  All of the structures on these properties are technically three-story structures because the finished elevation of the raised first floor is more than three feet above the site’s average natural grade level.  Figure 7 : Subject Sites with 3 rd Story Variances  Project No.  129 Fraser Avenue 40’ x 94’/3,760SF VAR00-004 140 Fraser Avenue 37.5’ x 94’/3,519SF VAR02-009 144 Fraser Avenue -(Subject site) 30’ x 94’/2,820SF VAR03-014 157 Fraser Avenue 35’ x 94’/3,290SF VAR98-052 125 Ocean Park Blvd 25’ x 94’/2,350SF VAR09-007 124 Hart Avenue 20’ x 94’/1,880SF VAR03-005 142 Hart Avenue 25’ x 94’/2,350SF VAR04-009 Additionally, there are many existing structures with roof decks and elevated rear balconies, as shown in Figure 8 below.  The subject block of Fraser Avenue has 30 lots and approximately 14 of those lots (46%) have permitted decks or balconies located in the rear yard setback that are located at the upper floor levels.  Two of those lots, 140 (adjacent to the subject site) and 132 Fraser Avenue have roof decks located above single story garages that are built at the rear property line.       Figure 8 : Neighborhood Context   The 100 block of Ocean Park Boulevard has 15 lots and approximately 8 of those lots (53%) have permitted decks or balconies located in the rear yard setback that are either at the upper floor or roof deck levels.  Four of the lots  ( 141,137, 133 and 125 Ocean Park Boulevard ) have permitted roof decks at or above the height of the proposed balcony at 144 Fraser Avenue. The 100 block of Hart Avenue to the south has 18 lots and 10 of those lots (55%) have permitted decks or balconies located in the rear yard setback that are at the upper floor levels.  The proposed third floor balcony expansion is consistent with the prevailing neighborhood characteristics as approximately 32 of the 63 lots (51%) within an approximate 300 foot radius of the subject site have decks or balconies at the upper floor or roof deck level.  The applicants proposed balcony expansion to 175 square feet is consistent with the size and location of most other upper floor balconies in the neighborhood . The proposed balcony at 144 Fraser Avenue would be setback 17 feet from the rear property line and would not encroach into the required rear yard setback of 15 feet and the required side yards of 4 feet. As such, the owner of the subject property was unreasonably deprived of the enjoyment and use of the property, as compared to other properties in the neighborhood.  Neighborhood Compatibility The proposed variance modification would not impair the integrity and character of the district in which it is to be located in that the proposed third floor balcony expansion is consistent with the prevailing characteristics of the neighborhood.  The majority of the existing residences within an approximate 300 foot radius of the subject property, which are identified in Figure 4 below, have upper level balconies located in the rear yards.  Appeal Summary On May 12, 2016, the appellant filed an appeal of the Planning Commission’s approval of the Variance. The full text of the appeal is presented in Attachment B. The appellant’s appeal statement explaining the reasons for the appeal are based on four primary points as summarized below: 1.  The Planning Commission’s f indings were subjective and not relative to who is directly impacted and therefore not justified.  2.  The a ppellant states that there are design - related issues due to removal of the roof mass encompassing the sides of the current balcony .  R eplacement of the roo f mass with the proposed balcony railings would further impact the adjacent neighbors.  3.  The a ppellant questions findings made in relation to height, massing, and pedestrian orientation. The existing height of the residence and deck expansion , if granted , would dominate over adjacent neighbor’s backyards.  4.  The appeal is to restrain or minimize the expansion of the third floor deck that was granted by modifying conditions Nos. 7 & 8 of the previously approved Variance 03-014. The size of the expansion greatly and adversely impacts and lessens the adjacent neighbor’s privacy. Appeal Analysis The Council, in its de novo review of this appeal, must determine whether the proposed project meets the findings required for a Variance identified in SMMC Section 9.24.040, provided in Attachment A. The Council may uphold the appeal or uphold the decision of the Planning Commission, in whole or in part, based upon these findings. As noted above the appellant has identified four points for overturning the Planning Commission’s decision. However, staff does not agree with the appellant’s appeal statement for the following reasons: 1. The appellant’s first point concerns that the findings  were subjective and not relative to who is directly i mpacted and therefore not justified. Staff contends that the project meets all of the required findings for a Variance as provided in Attachment A.  The property’s existing conditions with respect to parcel slope result in the building’s practical first floor to be considered a second floor and likewise, the second floor to be considered a third floor level, which creates a special circumstance with respect to how building design on the site relates to the applicability of the Zoning Ordinance . The conditions of approval restricting the size and location of the rear balcony created an unnecessary hardship that is more restrictive than the minimum requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, and result in an unreasonable deprivation of the use of the property as compared to the other properties in the neighborhood .  2.  The appellant’s second point contends there are design - related issues resulting from removal of the roof mass encompassing the sides of the existing deck .  Replacement with the requested balcony railings would only further impact the adjacent neighbors. In deciding to the approve the Variance, the Planning Commission reviewed the proposed balcony and found that t he removal of the roof massing to accommodate for the balcony expansion would actually reduce the massing at the rear elevation of the residence, therefore making the residence appear less dominating.  The 126 square foot balcony will remain within the mass of the existing residence and will be set back 3 feet from the sides of the existing residence.  The balcony will serve to permit outdoor activity that does not offer considerable visual access to adjacent private yards, thereby mitigating potentially detrimental impacts on adjacent neighbors.  In addition, since the balcony is accessed from the master bedroom, it is unlikely to be a location where significant social activities will occur.  3.  The appellant’s third point concerns the findings made in relation to height, massing, and pedestrian orientation. The existing height of the residence and deck expansion , if granted , would dominate over adjacent neighbor’s backyards. Staff contends that the existing height of the residence would actually appear less dominant due to the removal of the roof massing as indicated above.  Further, staff believes the proposed balcony extension would not materially change the existing development on the site and would not be visible from the street.  The prevailing street character will remain unchanged and the existing single-family residence would continue to be compatible in size and function to the surrounding residential neighborhood.  4.  Lastly, the appellant’s fourth point concerns the size of the expansion greatly and adversely impacts and lessens the adjacent neighbor’s privacy.  Staff contends that restricting the existing third floor balcony beyond 24 square feet would limit the property owner’s use and enjoyment of their property and causing the subject property to be unreasonably deprived compared with other properties in the immediate neighborhood that have larger size balconies located in the rear yard.  The third floor balcony expansion is consistent with the prevailing characteristic of the neighborhood with approximately 32 of the 63 lots (51%) within an approximate 300 foot radius of the subject site have decks or balconies at the upper floor or roof deck level.  Furthermore, staff believes due to the relatively small size of the approved balcony and its location from an upper-level master bedroom, the balcony does not have a natural propensity towards group activities that may generate higher noise levels than similar neighboring properties with balconies located in the rear yard and accessible from living areas within a residence. The third floor balcony is also significantly smaller in area than what would be permitted by code (360 square feet) and will be setback 17 feet from the rear property line and well within the required 4 foot side yard setbacks.  As detailed in the project and appeal analysis, there are special circumstances surrounding the proposed project and the subject site that warrant the support of the Variance request to extend the balcony.  In summary, the site is a sloping lot, which establishes a special circumstance where the technical third story requires the consideration of a Variance.  Furthermore, balconies are viewed by the Zoning Ordinance as building projections and not a part of the building volume that would otherwise be subject to the minimum setback requirements.  While the consideration of the Variance request allows the decision-maker the discretion to take into account impacts to the neighborhood, the conditions of approval restricting the size and location of the rear balcony created an unnecessary hardship that is more restrictive than the minimum requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, and result in an unreasonable deprivation of the use of the property as compared to the other properties in the neighborhood, as evidenced by the other third story additions and existing sizeable roof decks and rear balconies.  As proposed, the size and the location of the balcony complies with the setback and building volume envelope requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and would not grant any special rights to the property owner nor excessively impede upon the privacy of adjacency lots in any way that goes beyond the rights expressly granted by the Zoning Ordinance.  The proposed balcony extension would not materially change the existing development on the site and would not be visible from the street.  The prevailing street character will remain unchanged and the existing single-family residence would continue to be compatible in size and function to the surrounding residential neighborhood.  Requiring the property owner to comply with the conditions of approval from the previously approved Variance imposes a hardship that prevents the applicant from utilizing the property in substantially the same way that neighboring properties are, or could be, utilized. Community Outreach The applicant has informed staff that significant neighborhood outreach has been conducted on their part by personally contacting each owner and resident along the 100 block of Fraser and Ocean Park Boulevard to explain and describe the project scope . Alternatives As an alternative to the staff recommendation, the Council may consider the following with respect to the pending appeals if supported by the full evidentiary record:  1.  Uphold Variance (15ENT-0304) and deny 16ENT-0068 submitted by the appellant. 2.  Articulate revised findings and/or conditions to Approve OR Deny the subject appeal.  Environmental Status The project is categorically exempt from the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to Section 15301 Class 1 and 15331 Class 31, of the State Implementation Guidelines in that the project involves a minor alteration and 151-square third floor balcony expansion to an existing three-story building listed on the City’s Historic Resources Inventory.  The subject property is located in the South Beach District and is listed on the historic resources inventory with a 5B status code.  This evaluation code means that the structure appears to contribute to a potential historic district. The planned balcony addition appears to be consistent with the standards for maintenance, repair, and reconstruction as set forth in the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation of historic properties.  The historic character of the building will be maintained and no historic features or elements will be replaced or irreparably affected.  There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of the recommended action. 	\N	3

13	Urban Forest Master Plan Update	Public Works, Public Landscape	The Urban Forest Master Plan (Master Plan) serves as a guide for perpetuating , managing and enhancing Santa Monica’s urban forest. The plan establishes guiding principles, associated goals and more specific strategies to ensure community stewardship and best management practices for the urban forest. The proposed revisions would evolve the Master Plan to ensure its relevance in maintaining a sustainable, resilient and highly functioning urban forest for the community. The proposed revisions fall into three categories . First, new information that enhances protection of trees and wildlife, the removal process, appeals process, tree valuation and staff operations. Second, clarification of existing information that further defines things such as best management practices, species selection and urban forest management metrics, and third, grammar and punctuation corrections. Staff presented an overview of the proposed revisions to numerous boards, commissions, appointed bodies and neighborhood groups, and the Urban Forest Task Force (Task Force) unanimously approved the proposed revisions at its November 16, 2016 public meeting. 	On April 7, 2009 (Attachment A), Council approved the establishment of the Urban Forest Task Force to advise staff on the development of a long-range urban forest master plan, review specific urban forest issues, and serve in an advisory capacity to City Council until completion of the Master Plan.  On September 22, 2009 (Attachment B), Council appointed the seven-member Task Force to advise staff through the completion of the Master Plan , and on April 10, 2012 (Attachment C), Council reconstituted an Urban Forest Task Force for seven years as an advisory body to support the implementation of the Urban Forest Master Plan.  On December 13, 2011 (Attachment D), Council adopted the Proposed City of Santa Monica Urban Forest Master Plan, which also includes a Street Tree Designations List to replace street trees by street segment under strict removal criteria.  The Master Plan is the result of over two years of community input, research and planning by the Council appointed Urban Forest Task Force . The process involved extensive public input through surveys, community workshops and regular and special meetings of the Task Force. The Master Plan is an adaptive document that acknowledges the needs of the urban forest and will fluctuate over time. Therefore , the proposed revisions are part of a process to evolve the Master Plan so it continues to deliver strategic vision and guidance on the management and governance of the City’s urban forest. 	 As a result of the utilization of the Master Plan during the past five years, staff and the Task Force have identified necessary revisions to its content and vision. These revisions evolve the Master Plan to take account of climate change, maximize its effectiveness and sustainability while supporting a positive partnership of collaboration on the care of the City’s urban forest. Staff presented an overview of the changes , focusing primarily on species selection and planting prioritization , to the following 11 boards, commissions, appointed bodies and neighborhood groups for their input before the Task Force meeting on November 16, 2016: ·  Planning Commission ·  Landmarks Commission ·  Recreation and Parks Commission ·  Task Force on the Environment ·  Water Advisory Committee ·  Architectural Review Board ·  Friends of Sunset Park ·  North of Montana Association ·  Ocean Park Association ·  Santa Monica Mid-City Neighbors ·  Wil shire Montana Neighborhood Coalition  All boards, commissions, appointed bodies and neighborhood groups were supportive of the proposed revision s . The primary concern was that significant streets within the City do not lose their character. This would be addressed by creating individual planting plans for these streets by the Species Subcommittee of the Task Force.  Additionally, greater tree care education was requested to preserve the urban forest, particularly during the drought. Therefore, greater educational outreach would be developed in addition to planting more species that require minimal additional irrigation. The proposed revisions are summarized into the three categories of new information, clarification of existing information, and grammar and punctuation corrections and were unanimously approved by the Urban Forest Task Force at its November 16, 2016 public meeting.   New Information The following information would be added to Chapter Two - Guiding Principles of the Master Plan: ·  Inclusion of the legal protection of the city’s trees through the Santa Monica’s Municipal Code (SMMC 7.40 Tree Code) .  ·  Notification requirement for removals for all public trees, not just street trees. Young trees under five-inch diameter at breast he ight (DBH) would not require notification. Younger trees typically have a higher mortality rate during the establishment phase of 24 months. Adding this would enable staff to quickly replace those trees that may die. ·  Industry recognized tree valuation p rotocol from the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers. This valuation protocol is currently used and its inclusion in the M aster P lan is appropriate to ensure transparency and awareness of this practice. This protocol ensures tree canopy is not adversely impacted by the loss of healthy public trees when they need to be removed due to construction projects, traffic accidents, and other events by planting new trees . The number of replacement trees planted is based on the species, size and condition of the tree removed.  Currently, tree valuation is not included in the M aster P lan. ·  Language prohibiting the disruption of wildlife during tree care operations. ·  Language to allow staff to update text in the appendices t hroughout the document with the approval of the Task Force.  The appendices of the Master Plan are the tree care guidelines and species designations. Therefore, this would allow for the timely updating of this key information because it affects day-to-day urban forest operations. As of now, even minor operational changes to the Master Plan would need Council approval. ·  Language to expand the appeal process .  Currently, the public can only appeal the City’s decision to remove a tree. Staff proposes to add language that would allow the public to appeal the City’s decision to not remove a public tree. In both instances app eals would be heard by the Task Force. ·  Criteria added to define species selection and planting prioritization for street trees.  Clarification of Existing Information - Chapter Two Below is a table that describes the current language and proposed updates to the Guiding Principles section of the Urban Forest Master Plan ( Chapter Two ):  Broad language describing the goal of the City’s urban forest providing environmental benefits to the community. Definition of sustainable forest management and sustainable urban forest management metrics. Heritage Tree program was identified as a potential strategy to increase public understanding of the urban forest. Heritage Tree program has since been operationalized and launched. Broad language stating the City will follow best management practices and industry standards, but these are not defined in the current master plan. Precise industry standards and best management practices would be defined for tree pruning, planting, risk management and preservation during construction. Canopy priority listed as a strategy for enhancing the urban forest but without clear strategic goals defined. Add street tree planting prioritization based on urban forest metrics, environmental need and human need. Tree removal criteria found in the appendices and only includes street trees, not all public trees. Tree removal criteria moved from the appendices to the Guiding Principles section due to its importance and expanded to include all public trees. Number of days for the public notification of street tree removals is currently 14 business days. Other public trees do not require public notification. Reduce public notification from 14 to 10 business days to streamline the process. This would apply to all public tree removals, not only street trees. Increasing the City’s tree canopy cover identified as a strategy but with no specified goal. The goal for increasing urban tree canopy (UTC) over public property would be a 5% increase over 10 years. Current single species will not exceed 10% of the public tree population. I ncrease the species diversity goal to a maximum of 5% for any one species and add that any family  ( genus ) would not exceed 10%. This would add far greater environmental resilience to the urban forest by limiting the over-planting of species .  Clarification of Existing Information - Species Designations in the Appendices After an extensive review of the current street tree planting program, staff worked with the Task Force’s species subcommittee to modify this section for the reasons below: ·  Increase use of drought resilient species. ·  Replace poorly performing species or those not available from nurseries with those that would thrive better based on site conditions. ·  Improved and systematic matching of species based on growing space size a nd surrounding conditions such as overhead wires. This would reduce the use of larger species, such as Ficus, on narrow parkways. These changes would ultimately improve the sustainability and function of the urban forest while meeting the species diversity goal.  Grammar and Punctuation Minor grammar and punctuation edits would be made throughout the document. 	\N	3

37	Adopt a Resolution Authorizing an Additional Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Provider	Public Works, Office of Sustainability & Environment	The Office of Sustainability and the Environment is responsible for helping the City of Santa Monica meet established targets for energy reduction and greenhouse gas emissions as outlined in the 15 x 15 Climate Action Plan, ad o pted by Council in 2013. Also in 2013 , Council authorized Santa Monica’s participation in the Home Energy Renovation Opportunity (HERO) program. HERO is a provider of services and resources that connect home and building owners with incentives and rebates through a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program.  In 2016 , Council authorized staff to enter into member agreements with the California Home Finance Authority and the California Enterprise Development Authority Joint Powers Authorities (JPAs). Joining these JPAs allowed Ygrene, Energy Efficient Equity, Alliance NRG and California FIRST to begin providing PACE programs in Santa Monica.  Staff recommends that Council approve the attached resolution, authorizing Figtree to operate in Santa Monica as an additional PACE provider. 	PACE financing allows property owners to fund energy and water efficiency, renewable energy, and seismic retrofit projects with no up-front costs. When a PACE program is authorized, a municipality or county may form special tax districts or join designated joint power authorities with authorized PACE providers to help property owners finance these projects, allowing owners to place an additional tax assessment on their properties. Participating property owners repay the cost of the improvements through an assessment levied against their property which is payable in semi-annual installments on property tax bills. A lien is filed against the property as security until the assessment is repaid. The assessment remains with the property should the owner transfer or sell the property before the loan is repaid.  On July 13, 2010, Council authorized participation in the Los Angeles County Energy Program (LACEP) , which, at the time, offered financing to commercial property owners through a PACE program , per Attachment A .  On November 12, 2013, Council adopted a resolution to join Western Riverside Council of Governments (WRCOG) under its JPA thereby enabling the HERO PACE program to operate in the City of Santa Monica , per Attachment B .  On March 1 , 2016, Council adopted resolutions to join the California Home Finance Authority and the California Enterprise Development Authority under their JPA authority thereby enabling additional PACE programs to operate in Santa Monica including Ygrene, Energy Efficient Equity, Alliance NRG and CaliforniaFIRST , per Attachment C . 	 Since the authorization of HERO, 32 residential property owners have had potential solar photovoltaic and water and energy efficiency projects approved, and 4 jobs related to the projects have been created. Of those, 17 have been completed thus far, valuing $495,000 in total. In terms of lifetime impact, those 17 projects will provide $591,000 and $14,900 in energy and water bill savings, respectively. In terms of a lifetime reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 849 tons will be abated from the currently completed projects.  Since the authorization of the additional 4 PACE providers , 15 additional residential property owners have had potential solar photovoltaic, water and energy efficiency projects approved. Of those, 10 projects valued at $384,218 have been completed thus far, creating six jobs .  These projects will save 2.2 million kWh  of electricity and 1.4 million gallons of water , and 461 tons of greenhouse gas emissions over their projected lifetime .  In 2016, w hen Council authorized the following PACE service providers (HERO, Ygrene, Energy Efficient Equity, Alliance NRG and CaliforniaFIRST) to operate in Santa Monica , an incorrect resolution was included for the Figtree PACE program, and as a result that program has not been authorized to operate in Santa Monica . In an attempt to make multiple resolutions similar with one another, staff edited the language of the Figtree Resolution that effectively nullified the document.  The current resolution before the Council has been approved by Figtree and contains the appropriate language to authorize their ability to operate in Santa Monica. Figtree  has been in operation in California since 2010 and authorized by 196 local jurisdictions primarily financing commercial projects.  Figtree has since financed 55 commercial projects with a total approximate value of $16M .  The company recently merged with Dividend Solar to create Dividend Finance and will now formally offer residential PACE in its program areas .  In order to authorize Figtree as an additional PACE service provider, staff requests that Council adopt the attached resolution.  	\N	7
16	Property Insurance Brokerage Services	Finance Department, Risk Management Administration	The City has an ongoing need for professional property insurance brokerage services to underwrite, market, and secure its property insurance coverage.  This type of insurance protects the City’s buildings and vehicles, valued at over $890 million, from the perils of fire, flood and/or earthquake.  The City’s current property insurance broker agreement is set to expire at the end of this fiscal year, and in preparation for this, staff solicited proposals in accordance with procurement policies and received responses from three brokerage firms.  A panel of City staff subsequently evaluated each firm’s proposal and determined that Alliant Insurance Services, Inc. provided the most responsive bid.  The panel recommends the City pursue a five-year contract with Alliant at a cost of $425,000. 	Alliant Insurance Services, Inc. has served as the City’s property insurance broker for the last twenty-five years.  The City has maintained this long standing broker relationship with Alliant because it offers access to the Alliant Property Insurance Program (APIP) - formerly known as the Public Entity Property Insurance Program or PEPIP.  APIP was developed specifically to meet the unique needs of public entities, and as the largest property placement in the world, its market share and strength has helped to ensure the City obtains the best property insurance coverage at the most competitive price.  The City has participated in APIP since its inception and can only continue to do so as a client of Alliant.  The City’s current property insurance broker agreement with Alliant is set to expire on June 30, 2017 (see June 26, 2012 staff report).  The City continues to survey the market place for broker services every five years to determine what other property insurance options are available, and whether these options can compete with APIP’s offerings. 	 The City uses a professional property insurance brokerage firm to procure its property insurance coverage.  This is necessary for two reasons: 1) it ensures the City has access to the broadest range of high quality insurance coverage at the most competitive price, and 2) it provides the City with access to property insurance markets only available to professional brokers (e.g., earthquake coverage for City facilities, wave-wash coverage for the Pier, etc.).  The broker is responsible for all aspects of procuring property insurance.  This includes such tasks as evaluating the City’s property insurance program and recommending alternatives to address changing coverage needs; developing and marketing the program to insurers capable of meeting the City’s needs; and securing cost-effective coverage on behalf of the City. The City issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for property insurance brokerage services on October 17, 2016.  The RFP was posted on the City’s on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions.  A total of 118 vendors were notified of the RFP.  Of those notified, 10 prospective vendors downloaded the RFP and three brokerage firms submitted proposals (Alliant Insurance Services, Arthur J. Gallagher & Company, and AON Risk Services West, Inc.).  A panel of staff from the Finance, Housing and Economic Development, and Public Works Departments reviewed and evaluated the RFP submittals on the basis of experience, ability to fulfill the City’s unique property insurance needs, references, and cost.  The panel then conducted on-site interviews of all three firms.  Through this process, the panel confirmed that Alliant’s APIP continues to deliver the broadest property insurance coverage at the most competitive price.  Further, through APIP, the City is guaranteed access to difficult, but much needed, high risk property coverage (e.g., wave wash coverage for the Pier).  Finally, APIP provides a variety of valuable public entity-oriented coverages that are not offered in traditional property insurance policies.  For example, APIP provides municipal bond and tax revenue interruption coverage, wave-wash coverage, trained animal coverage (e.g., police dogs, mounted patrol horses, etc.), and ample policy limits ($1 billion in all-risk coverage).  Relative to broker fees, Alliant came in at mid-range; AON was higher, Gallagher was lower.  Based on the information presented above and SMMC 2.24.073 criteria, staff recommends Alliant Insurance Services, Inc. as the best qualified firm to serve as the City’s property insurance broker. 	\N	4
17	Study Session and Quarterly Update Regarding Civic Center Multipurpose Sports Field	Community & Cultural Services	City staff has continued discussions with SMMUSD staff to explore a potential partnership that would develop a permanent multipurpose sports field on the Civic Center parking lot with two levels of subterranean parking and have broadly discussed terms that should be considered as part of such partnership if it were to move forward. Staff also met with Coastal Commission staff to obtain their input regarding the development of a temporary sports  field on the site. Additionally, staff reissued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for design services for the temporary civic field and plans to award the feasibility and concept design portion of the contract at this time to RJM Design Group Inc. This would allow for some design work to proceed while ensuring flexibility as the project moves forward. 	On February 9, 2016 (Attachment A) staff presented the Civic Working Group Final Report and proposed next steps to Council. Council directed staff to explore the possibility of placing a temporary field at the corner of 4 th St. and Pico Blvd., to work with partners such as SMMUSD and Santa Monica College on funding options and to return to Council the following May with cost estimates. At the May 24, 2016 Council budget study session (Attachment B), funding totaling $200,000 was identified in FY 2016-17 as part of the FY 2016-18 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for design of the field.  Following considerable discussion and in response to public testimony, Council adopted a motion directing staff to earmark funds for the construction of the Civic Center multi-purpose sports field and to provide quarterly updates to Council on the status of the project to ensure that it moves forward as quickly as possible. The adopted FY 2016-18 CIP Biennial Budget includes $200,000 in FY 2016-17 for the design of the Civic Center sports field and the five-year CIP budget plan for FY 2016-17 through FY 2020-21 includes the use of reserve funds for the construction of the Civic Center sports field in FY 2018-19.  On October 25, 2016 (Attachment C) staff presented a quarterly update on the project at a Council study session. Following the presentation, staff was directed to: ·  Initiate a discussion with Coastal Commission staff regarding the temporary sports field project on the Civic Center parking lot and its resulting removal of approximately 600 spaces of surface parking; ·  Continue discussions with SMMUSD staff regarding a potential partnership project in the Civic Center to include subterranean parking and a permanent multi-purpose sports field with associated permanent amenities; and  ·  Reissue the Request for Proposals (RFP) to a wider range of potential firms for the design of the temporary field in an effort to identify a fee proposal that is aligned with the $200,000 budget in the FY 2016-17 CIP budget.  Staff proceeded per Council’s direction and issued an Information Item on January 17, 2017 to provide Council with an interim progress update (Attachment D). 	  California Coastal Commission In response to Council direction, City staff met with key Coastal Commission staff on January 17, 2017 to discuss the concept for a temporary multipurpose sports field in the Civic Center. The purpose of the meeting was to introduce Coastal Commission  staff to the concept of a temporary sports field in the Civic Center without construction of the underground parking associated with it in the Civic Center Specific Plan, and to ascertain the information that would be needed for them to evaluate this as a proposed temporary use which would cover more than 600 spaces in the existing surface parking lot.  For purposes of the discussion, we assumed an 8-10 year lifespan for the temporary sports field. Coastal Commission staff  indicated pursuant to the California Coastal Act, in ev aluating projects they are responsible for considering whether the project creates an adverse impact to public access to the beach for recreational purposes.  Additionally, they expressed concerns regarding mitigating the loss of parking and made it clear that any required mitigation would need to be implemented to coincide with the construction of the temporary field and that it would not be acceptable to delay mitigation of the loss of parking to a future permanent solution.  They also  expressed that they generally do not consider an 8-10 year timeframe as a temporary use.  With this in mind, Coastal Commission staff  indicated the following information would be required to consider such a request:  1)  Explanation of project phasing 2)  Description of the playing field ’ s purpose, potential users, and schedule of use 3)  Explanation of a long-term plan for permanent subterranean parking and the percentage that would be  associated with Civic Auditorium use 4)  A c omprehensive p arking a nalysis  would be needed to evaluate whether or not the temporary field, including the removal of existing surface parking, would impact coastal access.  The analysis would need to evaluate parking utilization  in the Civic Center surface parking lot, Civic Center parking structure, nearby beach parking lots, and nearby on-street parking by time of day and day of week over the proposed use period , and would need to analyze to what extent the removal of 600+ spaces would impact public access to the beach. The analysis would consider relevant aspects of Downtown parking utilization th at could reasonably affect the Civic C enter, but not necessarily all Downtown parking resources.  Coastal Commission staff indicated the study would need to consider uses in the area as well as the impacts on the timing of decisions made regarding the future repurposing of the Civic Auditorium , and  would expect the study to factor in all alternative modes of transportation including T ransportation D emand M anagement  (TDM) plans for all uses.   While Coastal Commission staff indicated their willingness to keep an open mind, they  cautioned that a loss of parking that impacts beach access – even if labeled as temporary – could impact the timing for other improvements in the area and especially the repurposing of the Civic Auditorium.  Lack of adequate parking availability could potentially pr eclude new activity, leaving the Civic dormant for many years i n the future.  The y expressed reservations regarding allowing a use with this level of parking impact to commence without imposing requirement s to off set or mitigate impacts to beach access, acknowledging that in their experience temporary uses can often become long- term given constituent support for them once in place. Further, Coastal Commission staff  indicated they would also want  to consider how to guarantee construction of permanent subterranean parking if a temporary field is constructed. They expressed concern that parking for Civic Center uses may be pushed into coastal lots and reduce beach users’ parking opportunities.   Coastal Commission staff indicated they will continue to consider and process applications for the Santa Monica Early Childhood Lab School (ECLS; formerly the ECEC) and the City Services Building (at such time as the application is filed) based on existing conditions as they accumulate; the field is not a submitted project at this time .  Potential Partnership with SMMUSD At the November 28, 2016 Board of Education meeting (Attachment E), SMMUSD staff presented options and tradeoffs regarding using School Bond Measure ES funding to implement development of Phases 1 and 2 of the Samohi Campus Plan (SCP) Blue Plan or alternatively implement Phase 1 of the SCP and partner with the City to develop a permanent sports field and subterranean parking structure on the Civic Center site (Attachment F). The Board directed its staff to work with City staff to explore whether there are feasible financing options to implement all three of the projects concurrently (Phases 1 and 2 of the SCP and the field with parking) and directed its staff to return with an update on January 19, 2017. While several Board members present weighed in on their preferences should they need to choose between options, they expressed interest in receiving input from the PTA Council and possibly others before making a decision. It was also noted that it would be important for all Board members to participate in making  t his decision should i t be necessary (Attachment G).  Subsequently, staff from the City and SMMUSD have performed due diligence for this potential partnership project including discussions with each institution’s financial advisors and bond counsel. As outlined in Attachment F, it is estimated that this project would range in a rough order of magnitude cost of $80-85 million. While SMMUSD could contribute a portion of the necessary funds from the District’s ES bond measure that was approved by voters in November 2012, there is insufficient City funding available to fully fund the project. City staff recommend consideration of a g eneral o bligation (GO) bond requiring approval by two-thirds of local voters in November 2018 to provide the necessary City support for the project, along with other anticipated park projects such as the construction of the expansion of Airport Park and Memorial Park and potentially other anticipated park and recreation projects .  City and District staff continue to me e t regularly to establish a recommended term s sheet for a partnership including matters such as financial contributions, management of design and construction, usage needs, and maintenance and operations responsibilities .   The City, in collaboration with the School District, will conduct an economic analysis of the project, considering such items as land value, construction, shared use, and maintenance , in order to establish a quantitative baseline for the permanent field cost sharing arrangement.   There are risks involved with each option .  If the City were to move ahead with a temporary field, the City would lose approximately 600 spaces of parking and the associated revenue in the Civic Center.  While some of this parking loss might be able to be absorbed within the D owntown area, there would be an impact on parkers who use this lot including employees, jurors and other visitors to the County Courthouse, Samohi ’s staff, parents and students , City employees and visitors and downtown parkers .  In fact we have received correspondence from the Superior Court of LA County expressing concerns about the possible loss of parking and the impacts that it would have on courthouse business (Attachment H). Additionally, as noted by Coastal Commission staff , a lack of parking would likely adversely affect any future negotiations with third parties for the repurposing and operation of the Civic Auditorium.   If the City were to move ahead with the School District partnership, it would likely complete the design of the permanent field before knowing the results of a GO bond vote in November 2018 in order to have a shovel-ready project .  I f the bond measure were to fall short , the funds necessary to design the field will have been risked .  Both options would increase field maintenance and operational costs for the City at a time when the City’s five year financial forecast is showing a growing structural deficit.   While both options present risks, the permanent field with parking below would be optimal for meeting the needs of the current uses in the area as well as the future use of the Civic Auditorium while providing a permanent solution for the multi-purpose field for use by SAMOHI teams and the general public as contemplated by the Civic Center Specific Plan.   Staff recommends that Council provide direction to continue discussions with SMMUSD staff on terms of a potential partnership.  Staff would return to Council with final terms of a proposed Memorandum of Understanding at such time as parameters are further defined .  Staff also recommends exploration of the scope and size of a potential Park General Obligation measure for the November 2018 ballot, including discussions with community stakeholders to assess support.  Design Consultant Selection Per the direction received from Council at the October 25, 2016 meeting, staff reissued RFP SP2461 for design services for the  temporary Civic field . Bids were  accepted from October 31, 2016 to November 30, 2016.  The RFP requested proposals for two scopes of work: a feasibility and concept design phase which would include preliminary outreach, programming of the site , initial concept design , and construction cost estimate ; and a design services phase which would follow completion of the feasibility phase and Council’s approval. Nine proposals were received and publicly opened on November 30, 2016. The proposals submitted range d  in total cost from $165,900 to $531,400. Staff from Public Works and Community & Cultural Services reviewed and rated the proposals based on selection criteria including fees, direct experience on similar projects, record performing public sector work, hourly rates for services, understanding of the project’s scope, approach to the work, qualifications of staff and proposed project schedule.  Based on the selection criteria, t hree design firms were short listed on December 21, 2016 - BFS Landscape Architects, BrightView Design Group and RJM Design Group Inc. (RJM). Following interviews on January 9, 2017, it was determined that RJM is the most qualified firm and best bidder based on the firm’s clear understanding of the project, track record of projects of similar scope, design team composition, previous experience with government agencies, fee structure and references.  The multidisciplinary team assembled by RJM is comprised of professionals in the fields of landscape architecture, urban planning, park and sports field design, and civil, electrical and geotechnical engineering. Additionally, a member of the RJM team has recent extensive experience obtaining permits from regulatory agencies, including the Coastal Commission and the City of Santa Monica. RJM has completed the award-winning Bonita Creek Park renovation project in Newport Beach that included the addition of approximately four acres of synthetic turf, enhancing access and playability for softball and soccer fields; Chino Hills C ommunity Park, utilizing synthetic turf surfacing and lighting for six  multi-use sports fields accommodating baseball, softball and soccer; and sports field projects for several other California cities including Lake Forest, Ontario, El Segundo and Temecula.  Given the City’s continuing discussions and potential partnership with SMMUSD, staff intends to proce ed with entering into a contract with RJM  only for the initial feasibility and concept phase  at this time in the amount of $47,025 which is within the City Manager’s contract authority. This would  allow the design for the temporary field  to move forward while providing flexibility should the scope of the project broaden to a permanent multipurpose sports field with subterranean parking .  T he feasibility study would determine the viability of designing a softball field to overlay a synthetic turf multipurpose sports field which would be useful regardless of whether the project is ultimately built as a temporary or permanent field.  Staff will  return to Council in June  2017 to  present results of the feasibility study and at that time could request authorization for contract modification to include the  full design phase portion of the contract in the amount of $203,973 (including a 10% contingency), depending on Council’s future determination of the project’s direction. Following modification, the proposed contract for the combined feasibility and design phases in addition to a 10% contingency would total $250,998.  Alternatively, Council could direct staff to add an action item to a future meeting agenda to authorize award of a contract with RJM for both feasibility and design phases in the proposed total amount of $250,998 (including a 10% contingency).  Lastly, s taff plans to return to Council to provide a quarterly status update in June  2017 to report on progress with the potential partnership with SMMUSD with the potential for seeking authorization to enter into an MOU , further discussions with Coastal Commission staff, and the status of t he project’s feasibility study.  Civic Center Plan Amendment  The Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) currently contemplates that subterranean parking will be constructed as part of the reconstruction of the east wing of the Civic Auditorium expansion.  An amendment to the CCSP will be required if the City and SMMUSD elect to proceed with the permanent multipurpose sports field with subterranean parking under the sports field instead of as part of the Civic Auditorium expansion.   Environmental Analysis  Under CEQA guideline 15262, a project involving only feasibility or planning studies for possible future actions which the City has not approved, adopted, or funded does not require preparation of an EIR or negative declaration.  Future actions to implement either the temporary or permanent sports field will require environmental analysis before approval, adoption or funding.

18	Second Reading and Adoption of an Ordinance Adopting Changes, Corrections, and Clarifications to the Zoning Ordinance, Chapters 9.01 Through Chapter 9.52 of Article 9 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code, Including Changes Related to Accessory Dwelling Units To Be Consistent with Recent Changes in State Law	City Attorney's Office - Second Reading	\N	\N	\N	\N	4
19	Annual Update on City Investment Policy and Resolution to Complete the Divestment the City's and Successor Agency’s Assets from Wells Fargo Bank	Finance Department, Treasury	To comply with State law, the City Council must adopt an investment policy and consider it annually at a public hearing (Attachment A).  Additionally, State law requires that the Council delegate investment authority to the City Treasurer for a one-year period, renewable annually, and the Santa Monica City Charter delegates the authority for investing City funds to the Director of Finance as the City Treasurer.  Staff is requesting that the Council and Successor Agency consider and adopt a revised investment policy and delegation of investment authority to the City and Successor Agency Treasurer for a one year period through February 28, 2018.  Additionally, following a Council motion on February 14, 2017 to divest the City’s funds from Wells Fargo Bank due to their business practices and their involvement in financing the Dakota Access Pipeline, staff is requesting that the Council and Successor Agency adopt resolutions setting forth steps to divest the City’s and Successor Agency’ s assets from Wells Fargo Bank. 	Per State law, City Council annually considers and approves the City’s Investment Policy (Attachment A) and delegates investment authority to the City Treasurer for a one-year period.  The current delegation of authority carries through February 28, 2017.  In addition, Santa Monica City Charter Section 711 delegates the authority to invest City funds to the City Treasurer.  On February 14, 2017, reacting to Wells Fargo Bank’s past fraudulent practices and to its involvement in financing the Dakota Access Pipeline, Council, under Item 13C, approved a motion for the City to break its relationship with Wells Fargo Bank, issue a new Request for Proposals for general banking services, immediately terminate its broker/dealer relationship with Wells Fargo, review its investment policy to include financial service institutions who finance 350.org companies as prohibited investments, and sell its Wells Fargo bonds, and asked staff to return with a plan on how to effectuate these changes in a practical and prudent manner. 	Investment Policy and Compliance with State law City investments are made only in those instruments specifically authorized by California State laws, primarily Sections 53601, 16429.1, and 53684 et seq. of the Government Code.  Within these legal guidelines, t he City’s Investment Policy and Investment practices have three primary objectives.  In priority order, these are : ·  Safety – Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the City’s investment program.  City investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio by diversifying its investments among a variety of securities offering independent returns.  ·  Liquidity – City investments are kept sufficiently liquid to enable the City to meet all operating requirements which might be reasonably anticipated by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrently with anticipated cash needs to the extent possible.  Investments are primarily made in securities with active secondary or resale markets.  Additionally, an adequate liquidity buffer is maintained for extraordinary circumstances.  ·  Rate of Return – The City’s investment portfolio is designed with the objective of attaining a benchmark rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account safety and liquidity requirements.  The benchmark may vary from time to time depending on the economic and budgetary conditions present.  The City continues to abide by the highest professional standards in the management of public funds.  While the investment strategy is flexible and can change based on market and economic conditions, the legal and policy guidelines governing these investment decisions remain relatively static.  On an ongoing basis, staff reviews public fund investment best practices and regulatory or legal changes to ensure City compliance.  Staff has reviewed the latest Local Agency Investment Guidelines Report issued by the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission.  There are no significant statutory changes requiring revisions to the City’s Investment Policy.  Additionally, the City’s Investment Policy was recertified by the Association of Public Treasurers United States and Canada (APT & US&C) in October 2016.  Wells Fargo Bank At its February 14, 2017 meeting, Council directed staff to completely divest from Wells Fargo Bank due certain disreputable business practices and its financing of the Dakota Access Pipeline.  The City and Successor Agency have a number of relationships with Wells Fargo, ranging from banking services to investments.  The following table lists the various relationships between the City and Successor Agency and Wells Fargo Bank.   General Banking Services (7 bank accounts) 3/31/2018  Not-to-exceed $750,000 over the five year term 3 rd Party Custodian for City’s investment portfolio 30 days’ notice $11,000 per year Broker Dealer Services Upon Notice $0 (compensation included in price offered for each specific investment  transaction Investments Maturing July 2020 and July 2021 The City’s investment portfolio includes two Wells Fargo bonds with a total book value of $4.6 million.   Bank Loan (Successor Agency) Maturing January 1, 2018;  To be paid off in full July 2017 (pending State DOF approval) $12.7 million remaining balance Cemetery/Mausoleum Perpetual Care Investment Management Contract terminated November 2016 N/A  The City expects to be fully divested from Wells Fargo Bank within 12 to 13 months.  While some divestments are immediate, others require a transition that includes competitive bidding for new services and complicated operational changes.  The following is a proposed plan for the changeover: ·  General Banking Services – The City’s current contract with Wells Fargo Bank terminates on March 31, 2018.  Changing banks providing general banking services is a very complex undertaking, requiring not just the movement of funds, but also changes to all the electronic payments to vendors, payroll direct deposits to staff, and purchasing card activities.  It also includes changes related to deposits being made by checks, cash, credit cards, electronic payments from State, County, and Federal agencies, other on-line deposits that require new software integrations, and deposits from lockbox facilities.  Converting to a new bank, from issuance of an RFP to the complete closure of all accounts with the old bank, can take twelve months.  Staff has already begun working on the RFP for banking services and expects to issue it in March 2017.  ·  Investment Portfolio Custodial Services – These services relate to investment transactions.  The third party custodian acts as the agent to ensure all investment transactions are settled properly and holds all City investments in safekeeping.  This contract can be terminated with 30 days’ notice by either party.  However, converting to a custodian, from issuance of an RFP to the complete transition to the new custodian, can take three to five months.  Staff will begin working on the RFP and should be able to issue it by mid-March with the goal of divestiture during the third quarter of 2017.  ·  Broker/Dealer Services – As noted above, Wells Fargo Securities is one of six broker dealers currently in the City’s approved list to conduct investment transactions.  This broker dealer agreement can be terminated at any time. Staff has stopped using the bank as a broker dealer immediately and will formally notify them of the termination of the agreement.  ·  Investments – As noted above, the City’s investment portfolio includes two Wells Fargo bonds with a total book value of $4.6 million with maturity dates of July 2020 and July 2021.  Based on the Council 2/14/17 motion that directed staff to sell the Wells Fargo bonds, staff has begun the process of selling the two Wells Fargo bonds in the City’s portfolio.  Losses on the divestment of these bonds will be $120,000.  No new Wells Fargo securities will be purchased for a minimum period of five years.  ·  Bank Loan (Successor Agency) – The original amount of the loan was $60 million with a final maturity date of January 1, 2018; the balance to date is $12.7 million.  The City is planning to pay off the remaining loan balance in July 2017 pending State Department of Finance approval.  While many public agencies are considering actions regarding their relationship with Wells Fargo, the following jurisdictions have taken significant action: ·  State of California – In September 2016, State Treasurer John Chiang sanctioned Wells Fargo by suspending the purchase of Wells Fargo Securities, use of Wells Fargo as a broker dealer for investment transactions, and use of Wells Fargo as an underwriter for the negotiated sale of State bonds.  The sanctions, put in place for one year, were in response to the certain fraudulent business practices that the bank was fined for.  ·  County of Santa Cruz – In October 2016, Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors directed the suspension of any new business with Wells Fargo for one year due to certain fraudulent business practices that the bank was fined.  ·  University of California – In January 2017, the University of California announced it will terminate $475 million in credit contracts with Wells Fargo over its ties to private correctional facilities.  ·  City of Seattle – On February 7, 2017, the Seattle City Council voted to not renew a contract with Wells Fargo for Bank Depository Services beyond the initial term of December 2018.  In addition, the Council action directed that the City will not purchase any new investments in Wells Fargo securities for a period of three years.  The reasons for the divestment were Wells Fargo business practices and its financial support of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).  ·  City of Davis – On February 8, 2017, the City of Davis City Council voted to divest from Wells Fargo due to its financing of the DAPL as well as the scandal regarding its business practices.  The City used Wells Fargo for general banking services and investment custodial services.  ·  City of Alameda – Will consider divestment from Wells Fargo at its February 21, 2017 meeting for the same reasons as described above.  Recommendations for Santa Monica In light of the Council’s actions on February 14, 2017, staff recommends that the Council and Successor Agency approve revisions to the City’s Investment Policy changing Section 17(b), Socially Responsible Investing, to state that  t he direct investment of City funds is restricted as follows:  “No investments will be made in fossil fuel companies as defined by the organization 350.org or in banking institutions that provide financing to said companies ” and also adopt the attached resolutions that set forth the following course of action to divest the City and Successor Agency’s assets from Wells Fargo Bank: ·  Issuance of a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for five years of new banking services with a qualified banking institution with a demonstrated commitment to and history of fair business practices, to take effect on or before March 31, 2018, the termination date of the City's current contract with Wells Fargo Bank;  ·  Issuance of a new RFP for investment portfolio custodial services with a goal of divestiture from Wells Fargo by the third quarter of 2017;  ·  Immediate termination of Wells Fargo Securities as the City's broker dealer;  ·  Payment of the Successor Agency's outstanding loan obligations to Wells Fargo, pending approval by the State Department of Finance.  ·  Disqualification of any banking institution that has been subject to a consent order for improper sales practices, placed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or other federal or state regulatory agency with jurisdiction to protect consumers from improper sales practices, from providing investment, debt, and/or banking services to the City if the consent order was issued within five years of the City's solicitation for such services. 	\N	4
20	Authorizing Prosecutors and Staff in the City Attorney's Office Access to California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS)	City Attorney's Office	Under the Penal Code, a person’s criminal history information is confidential. However, specific categories of public officials may have access to criminal history information to perform their jobs. The Penal Code authorizes the City of Santa Monica ("City") to designate its prosecuting Deputy City Attorneys and support staff to have such access, because that information is needed to perform their duties. Staff recommends that Council adopt t his resolution which would grant access to criminal history information to specific job titles, not specific employees by name.  Employees with those specific titles , would have the necessary access to carry out their duties. 	The California Department of Justice maintains a statewide database of criminal history information for law enforcement purposes. Access to that information is through the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS). To access the database, a person must have statutory authorization. Penal Code section 11105, subdivisions (b)(4) and (11) authorizes prosecuting City Attorneys and staff to access criminal history information in the performance of their duties, however the Council must adopt a resolution specifically granting staff authority , before they can access CLETS to carry out their duties.

23	Award of Construction Contract for Street Lighting Improvements on Stewart Street	Public Works, Civil Engineering	The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) FY2016-17 Action Plan  provided  $313,815  in funding for an eligible stree t lighting project within the Pico Neighborhood, in particular on Stewart Street from Exposition Boulevard to Kansas Avenue. With these f unds, fifteen (15) new Light Emitting Diode (LED) energy-efficient fixtures and street light poles  would be installed.  Currently, this area has minimal lighting , but once complete, the additional lighting would encourage walking and facilitat e access to transit,  the light rail station , parks, schools , and other  community facilities and is aligned with Council’s Vision Zero strategy .  Elecnor Belco Electric, Inc. (Elecnor Belco), the lowest bidder, is recommended for this project for an amount not to exceed $190,895 (including a $24,900 contingency ) and would be funded through C DBG . 	The segment of Stewart Street between Exposition Boulevard and Kansas Avenue  is adjacent to the Mountain View Mobile Home Park (MVMHP) within the Pico Neighborhood, and provides connectivity to the Expo Light Rail, Ishihara Park and Gandara Park.  Reside nts of the adjacent MVMHP  voiced concerns about the street and sidewalk lighting  during a community outreach meeting in November 2015 for the neighborhood lighting project along Michigan Avenue, which is currently under construction.  Typically, residents must go through the streetlight assessment process when requesting new lighting.  However, the timing of this request coincided with the planning of CDBG available funds and met the eligibility grant requirements to fund this project. Civil Engineering staff identified CDBG funds as an available source of funding to implement these improvements and funds were requested and approved in the City’s FY 2016-17 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) budget. 	 If awarded, fifteen (15) new octagonal concrete street light poles with “cobra-head” style LED fixtures would be installed in a staggered pattern approximately 60-feet apart along Stewart Street between Exposition Boulevard and Kansas Avenue (Attachment B ). The City’s lighting consultant, Willdan Engineering, conducted a photometric analysis based on street lighting standards established by the City of Los Angeles, Bureau of Street Lighting (BSL) and the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) of North America, to determine the height and spacing of the street light poles, and the type and wattage of the LED fixtures.  The style of the street light poles was selected to match the existing street light poles on Stewart Street to the north and south of this location. The LED fixtures specified are dark-sky friendly, limit upward and visual glare, and have been specified to minimize any potential effects to human sensitivity.  The increase in lighting would encourage walking, biking , and transit use especially by residents who travel during twilight hours and after dark . Further, the additional lighting is consistent with Council’s Vision Zero directive laid out in the Pedestrian Action Plan adopted by Council February 23, 2016 . Nighttime safety is a substantial concern among residents and multiple user surveys have named lighting as a key reason that people do not walk more. By creating well-lit pedestrian routes, especially to the new light rail stations, mobility would be enhanced. Additionally, the proposed lighting would ensure that these streets are perceived as safe pedestrian routes , encourage alternative forms of transportation, and reduce single occupant automobile trips. Contractor Selection On February 14, 2017, the City published a Notice Inviting Bids for the installation of CDBG funded street lighting on Stewart Street between Exposition Boulevard and Kansas Avenue in accordance with City plans and specifications. The bid was posted on the City's on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. Forty-four vendors downloaded the bid.  Seven bids were received and publicly opened on March 8, 2017. Bid results are as follows:  Bidder          Base Bid Elecnor Belco Electric       $165,995  Calpromax Engineering       $184,790  Comet Electric        $191,982  Dynalectric         $204,545  ND Construction Company       $220,516 L.A. Traffic Signal Transportation      $248,910 Aegis ITS         $256,325*  (* = Rounded to the nearest dollar )  Bids were evaluated based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, capability to perform the work, experience on similar projects, availability of material, equipment and qualified staff, understanding of the project requirements, ability to meet the desired time frames, and performance on similar projects.  Staff contacted references provided by Elecnor Belco for traffic signal and street lighting projects in the cities of Glendale, Newport Beach , and Orange, which were completed in 2015, and additional projects for the cities of Los Angeles, Victorville and Irvine, which were completed in 2014. All reference agencies reported that work was completed in a timely and cost-efficient manner while maintaining consistent quality. Staff also verified with the Contractor’s State License Board that Elecnor Belco’s license is current, active, and in good standing.  Construction Management Construction management and public outreach for this project will be provided by City staff.  Construction management include s inspecting the contractor’s work during construction, verifying and documenting field changes and unforeseen conditions, monitoring and mitigating impacts as a result of the construction activities, attending contractor’s safety meetings, attending periodic progress meetings, and maintaining all necessary inspection documentation relevant to the work conducted during construction.  Public outreach include s notifications distributed to adjacent properties and the surrounding community on the scope of the project, potential impacts and schedule with additional periodic updates.  Timeline Construction for this project is anticipated to begin in June 2017 and last approximately 6 months. 	\N	5
24	Resolution of the Santa Monica Public Financing Authority Establishing Regular Annual Meeting Dates	Finance Department, Revenue Division	Effective January 1, 2010, Section 6592.1 was added to the California Government Code requiring that “A resolution authorizing bonds or any issuance of bonds or accepting the benefit of any bonds or the proceeds of bonds shall be adopted by an authority only during a regular meeting he ld pursuant to Section 54954.”  On May 10, 20 11 , the Board of Directors (the Board) of the Santa Monica Public Financing Authority (the Authority) established a regular meeting to be held on the fourth Tuesday of every May on the same date and time as a regular meeting of the City Council of the City.  On October 11, 2011 , the Board established a second regularly scheduled meeting to be held on the fourth Tuesday of October.  Staff recommends changing the May regular meeting date to the second Tuesday in June because the current May date is now used exclusively for budget study sessions. This meeting schedule revision will allow the Authority to authorize bond issuance at a regularly scheduled meeting held on the second Tuesday of June or the fourth Tuesday of October each year , and thus meet the requirements of Section 6592.1 of the California Government Code.  If the Board determines that there is no business of the Authority to be conducted at a regular meeting, then the Board is authorized to take whatever actions are required by law to cancel the regularly scheduled meeting. 	On Jul y 25, 1995 , as authorized by Resolution No. 8923(CCS), the Santa Monica Public Financing Authority was organized pursuant to applicable provisions of the California Government Code Section 6500 et seq., and a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement, dated July 25, 1995, by and between the City and the Redevelopment Agency of the City of Santa Monica.  The purpose of the Authority is to provide financing for its members or other local public agencies in connection with the acquisition, construction and improvement of public capital improvements, working capital requirements , or liability or other insurance needs of its members or other local agencies.  The Redevelopment Dissolution Law (at Health & Safety Section 34178 (b)(3)) specifically provides that joint powers agreements in which the former Redevelopment Agency is a member of the joint powers authority (JPA) remain valid and bind the successor agency, subject to the constraints on the successor agency under the Redevelopment Dissolution Law, which effectively means that the JPA cannot use its authority to use tax increment as a means of financing and that action by the Successor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency, such as its approval of an amendment to the joint powers agreement, is subject to the terms of Redevelopment Dissolution Law.  The current recommended actions, however, are not constrained by the Redevelopment Dissolution Law.  Therefore, no action is required by the Successor Agency as a condition to the recommended actions. 	 Effective January 1, 2010, Section 6592.1 was added to the California Government Code requiring that “A resolution authorizing bonds or any issuance of bonds or accepting the benefit of any bonds or the proceeds of bonds shall be adopted by an authority only during a regular meeting held pursuant to Section 54954.”  Section 3.04 of the current Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement provides that “if the Board decides to hold regular meetings, such regular meetings shall be held at such time as the Board of Directors may fix by resolution from time to time.”  The attached Resolution sets the date and time of the Authority’s regular meeting on the second Tuesday of June and the fourth Tuesday of October of every year, to be held as a joint meeting with the City Council.  If the Board determines that there is no business of the Authority to be conducted at a regular meeting, then the Board is authorized to take whatever actions are required by law to cancel the regularly scheduled meeting.  Additional regularly scheduled meetings may be added by resolution in the future in connection with other future financings. 	\N	5

26	Design approval for the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan Streetscape	Strategic Planning (PCD)	Since successfully taking over responsibility for Lincoln Boulevard from Caltrans in 2012, the City of Santa Monica has worked with local residents and businesses to improve one of our community’s most important but neglected transportation and business corridors. The Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan (the “LiNC”) consists of two main components: enhancing the physical environment and pedestrian safety through streetscape improvements and supporting the aesthetic transformation of the corridor by incentivizing the remodel of existing businesses.  The project has reached a milestone with the completion of the final design concept for the streetscape and transportation proposal.  This report provides information on the streetscape design effort, and summarizes the various design components and programmatic changes that will be implemented over time.  Council is being asked to approve the LiNC streetscape design and transportation concept now prior to the completion of the project’s business improvement measures, which are being developed on a separate timeline. The proposed streetscape and transportation enhancements would fulfill the Land Use and Circulation Element’s (LUCE) policy direction to transition the busy commuting corridor of Lincoln Boulevard into a pedestrian-oriented environment.  Work on the streetscape and transportation concept has spanned several years, and has identified opportunities for new crosswalks, landscaped medians and pedestrian refuges, pedestrian lighting, bicycle connectors and many other elements.  Importantly, the LiNC has integrated a peak commute-hour dedicated bus lane into the right-of-way (with no net impact to vehicle flow) as a means to support Lincoln’s role as a transit priority corridor and to increase transit ridership. Recent work on the streetscape and transportation concept has involved identifying a realistic phasing program for implementation that takes into account a variety of factors such as construction costs, available funding sources, pedestrian and bicycle crash data, emergency vehicle access and alignment of project purpose with the City’s strategic initiatives. Two phases of work have been identified. At its February 15, 2017 meeting, the Planning Commission unanimously recommended approval of the LiNC streetscape and transportation plan. 	The project area is located within three neighborhoods along 17 blocks of Lincoln Boulevard from the I-10 Freeway (including the bridge overpass) to Ozone Avenue, approximately 1.25 miles long . The project boundaries include the vehicular right-of-way, as well as the public sidewalk and the ground floor of the buildings that front Lincoln Blvd.  Caltrans relinquished Lincoln Boulevard to the City of Santa Monica in 2012, which stimulated public and private interests in addressing deferred maintenance issues and in fulfilling the vision of the LUCE for a more walkable and aesthetically pleasing corridor.  In 2013, the Public Works Department and Traffic Engineering Division conducted a street resurfacing and striping project that improved vehicular operations and laid the groundwork for future transit efficiency by modifying right-of-way striping to accommodate potential dedicated bus lanes.  The resurfacing project improved the visual condition of Lincoln Boulevard, but left more substantive streetscape modifications (such as medians or crosswalks), policy recommendations and other enhancements to be resolved by the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan. On June 10, 2014  (ATTACHEMNT G) the City Council authorized the City Manager to negotiate and execute a contract (CCS #9651) with Community Design and Architecture (CD+A) to prepare a detailed streetscape and transportation concept for Lincoln Boulevard between the I-10 Freeway and the City limits at Ozone Avenue. The Council later authorized an amendment to t his contract on July 28, 2016 to provide additional design development to address emergency access concerns from the Fire Department. Streetscape Plan Development Beginning in August 2014, an interdepartmental team led by Planning and Community Development began work on the LiNC to develop streetscape, transportation and business improvement concepts.  Leveraging relationships with neighborhood leaders and members of the Lincoln Boulevard Taskforce, the planning team conducted extensive outreach to address key concerns and develop consensus on a preferred streetscape alternative.  Outreach activities included two community workshops, dozens of one-on-one and group stakeholder meetings, focus groups with local businesses, and an online presence that included social media and civic engagement platforms. Since August 2014, staff has presented LiNC concepts to the Planning Commission, City Council and other boards and commissions to further refine streetscape and transportation enhancements. Feedback was used to direct resources to specific issues that warranted additional research and investigation.  Staff met with the Planning Commission on three occasions: 1) on October 1, 2014  (ATTACHMENT H) to introduce the project and obtain directional guidance, 2) on September 2, 2015  (ATTACHMENT I) to solicit input about emerging plan elements and obtain direction on key policy questions that had surfaced during concept development, and 3) on February 15, 2017  (ATTACHMENT J) to finalize the streetscape concept and take action on a unanimous recommendation for approval. Staff presented the LiNC project to the City Council on one occasion on November 24, 2015 (ATTACHEMNT K) . At subsequent public meetings before the Recreation and Parks Commission, Architectural Review Board and in community workshops, staff received additional guidance, and interdepartmental team members helped the project team refine design criteria and implementation options that informed the final concepts presented in this staff report.  Public Participation and Community Outreach In collaboration with multi-departmental staff, the project team has worked with a wide range of constituents to develop streetscape, transportation and business improvement concepts.  Neighborhood leaders communicate frequently with staff through the Lincoln Boulevard Taskforce, which includes representation from the Ocean Park, Sunset Park and Pico neighborhoods, as well as from the Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District.  The outreach effort has involved many different forms of outreach in which participants have explored the range of issues, concerns and ideas surrounding the Boulevard, and have worked with staff to develop a preferred alternative.  Outreach has involved two well-attended community workshops, stakeholder interviews and focus groups, regular meetings with the resident-led Lincoln Boulevard Taskforce, and technology and social media platforms. A separate effort to work with Boulevard businesses on any perceived impacts from the proposed commute-hour dedicated bus lane has also been conducted and is described in more detail later in this report. 	The final streetscape and transportation design incorporates elements that have been identified by the community as important to connectivity and livability.  Additional design criteria have been established by various City departments who provide emergency or maintenance services.  Concepts have also been aligned with federal and state guidance on roadway design, and the landscaping proposal acknowledges California’s historic drought. During the design process, each block has been individually analyzed for opportunities to accommodate the features that are desired by the community, and which support the goals of the project. The final streetscape plan incorporates a balanced mix of new features that result in a better performing, enhanced streetscape and transportation environment for vehicles, transit , pedestrians and bicycles . None of the streetscape elements being proposed results in the loss of a travel lane for vehicles.  The improvements are intended to make movement  for all users and modes more predictable by providing safe places for pedestrians to cross the street , identify areas for bicycles to maneuver, accommodate transit, and organize vehicle flow. The following are brief descriptions of the design features incorporated into the final design. Lincoln Boulevard Streetscape and Transportation Design Features ( ATTACHMENT A ): ·  New peak commute-hour 12-foot wide dedicated Bus Lanes ·  New landscaped center medians, 10 feet average width, various lengths ·  3 new crosswalks with pedestrian-actuated safety signals across Lincoln Boulevard located at Grant, Pine, and Wilson/Pier Streets ·  4 enhanced crosswalks that integrate new pedestrian refuges at Olympic, Pearl, Hill and Ashland ·  New crosswalk striping at 20 locations on side streets ·  ADA compliant dual-directional curb ramps at 90 locations along the boulevard ·  125 new pedestrian lights spaced at 75 foot average intervals ·  13 new curb-extensions and bulb-outs at strategically located side streets and in certain areas on Lincoln Blvd. north of Pico Blvd. ·  2 new bicycle connection improvements at Ashland and Pearl ·  48 new street trees in existing and/or future parkways and potentially in medians ·  32 bioswales for stormwater runoff ·  New bike racks, benches and trash receptacles ·  Eliminated unused curb-cuts and revised curb ramps ·  Wayfinding signage and markers The primary objectives of the LiNC streetscape are to guide the transition of Lincoln Boulevard into a pedestrian-friendly environment and to improve transportation conditions for vehicles, transit and bicycles.  These objectives are helpful in distilling the many components of the project into a logical implementation sequence and funding rationale.  A careful review of the corridor concept was undertaken to determine which elements would: 1) provide highly visible and effective improvements to existing conditions for pedestrians, vehicles, transit and bicycles; 2) be implemented in the short-term; 3) balance cost with benefit; 4) be cost-competitive against competing projects; 5) require the least amount of disruption to traffic flow and to the local business environment, and 6) address locations where crash data identified the need for additional attention. Out of this analysis emerged two implementation phases: ·  Phase 1 involves a discrete set of streetscape elements that target “connections.” The estimated cost for Phase 1 improvements is approximately $2. 9 million and could be fully implemented by the end of 2018 if appropriate approvals, funding resources and processing timelines are pursued efficiently. For a list of Phase 1 improvements, please see ATTACHMENT B . ·  Phase 2 includes a package of costlier upgrades and more intense construction activities that would fully complete the streetscape proposal.  The estimated cost for Phase 2 improvements is estimated to exceed $10 million, and may take several years, if not more, to accumulate funding through grants and internal funding resources prior to full implementation.    3 new crosswalks with pedestrian-actuated safety signals across Lincoln Boulevard locate d at Grant, Pine, and Wilson/Pier Streets 4 enhanced crosswalks that integrate new pedestrian refuges at Olympic, Pearl, Hill and Ashland  New landscaped center medians, 10 feet average width, various lengths  New crosswalk striping at 20 loc ations on side streets  13 new curb-extensions and bulb-outs at strategically located side streets and in certain areas on Lincoln Blvd. north of Pico Blvd. 48 new street trees in existing and/or future parkways and potentially in medians  3 2 bioswales for stormwater runoff 125 new pedestrian lights spaced at 75 foot average intervals Eliminated unused curb-cuts and revised curb ramps  ADA compliant dual-directional curb ramps at 90 locations along the boulevard  Wayfindin g Signage and Markers   New Peak Hour Directional 12-foot wide Dedicated Bus Lanes 2 new bicycle connection improvements at Ashland and Pearl New bike racks, benches and trash receptacles  Peak Hour Directional 12-foot Dedi cated Bus Lanes (Phase 1) Based on in-depth analysis on the applicability and benefits transportation enhancements, such as dedicated bus lanes on Lincoln Boulevard, staff recommends that the peak commute-hour dedicated bus lane lead the implementation of Phase 1. This network enhancement includes: ·  Peak Hour conversion of 12-foot parking lane to directional bus-only lane ·  Activation: Northbound 7-10AM, Southbound 4-7PM ·  Curbside lane configuration to accommodate existing BBB vehicles ·  Travel time savings of approximately 10 minutes within Santa Monica in each direction ·  Potential travel time savings of 25+ minutes if extended to the Green Line Station The implementation of the dedicated bus lane does not require the same intensity of physical intervention that other Phase 1 components necessitate. Construction of the dedicated bus lane is limited to the application of a solid stripe in the roadway to define the lane, and the installation of signage prohibiting parking or vehicles to use the lane during operations. Staff has successfully secured full funding for the bus lanes implementation, which could be delivered as early as summer 2017. Outreach on the Bus Lane  In early spring 2017, staff from PCD and BBB collaborated on a distinct outreach campaign to Boulevard businesses regarding the commute-hour dedicated bus lane. The purpose of this targeted one-on-one outreach was to provide businesses with the opportunity to offer additional feedback outside of the workshops, stakeholder and focus groups and online participation platforms that have been addressing Boulevard issues publically for the past two years.  Working in teams, staff individually visited all of the Boulevard’s 128 businesses and spent time discussing the larger project, as well as the perceived impacts of the bus lane during its proposed operational hours. A dedicated GO feedback portal was opened to receive comments from the web, and staff distributed their phone numbers for follow-up.  The following is the result of the outreach: ·  87% of  businesses are either supportive, indifferent or non-responsive on the subject of the commute-hour dedicated bus lane ·  4% of businesses have a concern about the bus lane or the project as a whole ·  9% of businesses oppose the commute-hour dedicated bus lane Interdepartmental staff is working with the small percentage of businesses who have expressed a concern to identify solutions that limit potential impacts. A complete description of the outreach process and individual businesses who expressed concerns is provided in ATTACHMENT F . Three New Crosswalks (Phase 1) To promote east/west connectivity, three new crosswalks are proposed at Grant, Pine and Pier Streets, which will also aid in further unifying the relationship between neighborhoods, and reducing the divisiveness of Lincoln Boulevard.  The addition of these three new crosswalks located at un-signalized intersections creates a consistent and predictable crossing pattern, approximately 600 feet (or two blocks) between crossing opportunities.  Crosswalks will be accompanied by rectangular rapid flashing beacon (RRFB) signalization devices to alert drivers to the presence of a pedestrian. These proposed new crosswalks are activated by the crossing pedestrian, and do not have an impact to traffic operations. Staff analyzed ten years of crash data to finalize the locations for new crosswalks ( ATTACHMENT C ) between the years 2005-2015.  During that time, a total of 660 crashes involving pedestrians or cyclists have been recorded on Lincoln Boulevard, including 5 fatalities. T All new crosswalks will also be enhanced with landscaped medians in order to provide pedestrian refuges for safe harbor after crossing one direction of traffic, and before taking on the next. Four Conversions of Existing to Enhanced Crosswalks (Phase 1) Data has confirmed that p ast upgrades to Lincoln Boulevard’s existing crosswalks have reduced the prevalence of conflicts at many major intersections, but further potential improvements have been identified through the LiNC process.  Improvements to crossing conditions at Olympic, Pearl, Hill and Ashland are proposed in the form of new landscaped medians that are integrated into the crosswalk. Identical to the approach for the new crosswalks, these enhancements would create refuge areas for crossing pedestrians, and in some instances, such as at Hill Street, would be accompanied by additional safety and lighting devices. Landscaped Medians (Phases 1 and 2) Overall, approximately 2000 linear feet of landscaped center medians would be provided along the Boulevard in select locations to green the Boulevard and to improve the flow and organization of traffic. A modicum of landscaping that is drought tolerant and adheres to Fire and Police criteria for visibility is recommended. Trees are not viable in the medians south of Pico Boulevard due to the presence of major utilities beneath the roadway, but medians north of Pico Boulevard could accommodate some trees. Staff recommends phasing in the medians over time, focusing first on adding medians and refuges at crosswalk locations, then later filling in larger stretches of the Boulevard after a period of observation. Phase 1 implementation proposes the installation of roughly 700 linear feet of medians adjacent to new and enhanced crosswalks, which constitutes about 30% of the full median scheme outlined in the Streetscape plan. A subsequent phase of work would involve the build-out of the remaining 70% of medians, which would provide substantial traffic flow control in addition to the landscaping.  Staff recommends that the City evaluate how the Phase 1 medians affect emergency access for at least a two-year period prior to wholesale implementation of corridor-wide medians. Side Street Crosswalk Striping and ADA Compatible Curb Ramps (Phases 1 and 2) To improve Boulevard access for people of all mobility levels, and to provide a visible space in the right of way for non-motorized crossings, crosswalk enhancements are proposed at every un-signalized intersection and side-street within the project area. This includes continental crosswalk striping (i.e. zebra-striped pattern) from curb to curb in 20 locations, as well as rebuilt curb ramps for ADA compliance at 90 locations (52 are included in Phase 1). Curb Extensions and Bulb-Outs (Phase 1) To promote pedestrian activity, greening of the Boulevard and neighborhood unity, Phase 1 contemplates the construction of all 13 of the curb extensions identified in the full corridor plan. The street design includes the use of curb extensions and bulb-outs at select locations within the project area to enhance connectivity, landscaping and potential stormwater capture. Opportunities to locate public art have also been identified in several of these locations. Bicycle Connection Improvements (Phase 1) Improved bicycle connections are proposed at Pearl and Ashland, which serve as crossover routes for cyclists moving along the established bikeways of 7 th Street (west of Lincoln) and 11 th (east of Lincoln). Pearl Connector Signage and markings are a recommended addition on the west side of Lincoln to provide visibility for cyclists utilizing the existing bike network of ”sharrows” on Strand, Kensington and 7th Street to form a couplet where eastbound movements would use Kensington and additional “Keep Clear” markings across Lincoln would assist with crossing the Boulevard. A new bike box is proposed to be painted on the westbound approach. Ashland Connector Similar to the configuration at Pearl, a couplet is proposed which would use 7 th Street, Raymond and Ashland.  “Sharrows” are proposed on the west side of Lincoln on 7th Street northbound only and Raymond eastbound only.  Signage would be added at the intersections of 7th and Ashland, 7th and Raymond, and then Lincoln/Strand to help formalize the couplet concept.   Additional Bicycle Improvements The proposed striping for a commute-hour bus lane will provide a 12-foot space adjacent to the curb. During morning/evening commute hours, this space will function as a dedicated bus facility , and prominent signage will prohibit motorists and cyclists from traveling in this space during those hours . However, when not in operation as a bus lane, this space will provide 5 feet of additional roadway space between parked cars and the number 1 travel lane for cyclists.  This will allow those who choose to ride on Lincoln more biking space, although not in a designated bicycle facility. New Street Trees (Phases 1 and 2) There is an opportunity to plant 48 new trees along the project area in sidewalk locations along the Boulevard, and in select medians north of Pico Boulevard.  In accordance with the proposed Phase 1 improvements, 24 new trees are scheduled to be planted within the next year either in existing vacant tree wells, or in new parkway areas that are incorporated into the design. Staff worked extensively with the City’s Urban Forester and Urban Forest Task Force to identify four new tree species that will be used to complement the street’s existing tree inventory and help achieve the Urban Forest Master Plan’s objectives for species diversity.  Going forward, as existing trees reach the end of their natural lives, they will be replaced with the four species shown in ATTACHMENT A . Pedestrian Lighting (Phase 2) The full LiNC streetscape proposes the installation of 117 pedestrian lights and 8 pedestrian safety light poles. Standing at 13-17 feet high, these top-shielded LED lighting poles would be spaced approximately 75 feet apart to supplement the existing auto-oriented light standards.  The addition of pedestrian lights to the boulevard requires an upgrade of the electrical network to allow for LED multiple-series connections. The cost of the pedestrian lights and associated electrical work exceeds $3.5 million, which presents a financial barrier at this moment in time. Staff will seek funding for the lights, which may be addressed through an upcoming Metro Call for Projects, or the Highway Safety Improvement Program. Stormwater Infiltration (Phase 2) It is the intent of the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor plan to apply appropriate storm water best management practices (BMP) as part of the effort to comply with any applicable provisions of the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) discharge permit.  These BMPs include permeable surfaces, retention basins, and underground infiltration chambers. These would be implemented to the maximum extent practicable. Because many of the stormwater features are located beneath the roadway, it is recommended that they be installed at the same time that the full corridor landscaped medians are implemented to take advantage of efficiencies in construction. The LiNC project also includes a substantive business improvement and beautification effort, which involves short-term common-sense strategies as well as longer-term management programs that engage the local business community in supporting a more functional, aesthetically pleasing pedestrian experience. Due to the level of effort required to get many of these programs and activities off the ground, staff is not ready to bring them all forward for approval at this time, but will continue to develop them over 2017 and 2018. ·  Property-Based Business Improvement District: One of the long-term goals of the LiNC is to assist in the formation of a formal or informal merchant association that supports Lincoln Boulevard businesses through group representation and advocacy. As part of the LiNC process, the project team has held extensive outreach with the Lincoln Boulevard business community and boulevard property owners. The next phase of work will involve growing interest among property owners and further refining district priorities.  Subsequent phases may involve hiring a Business Improvement District professional to help define district boundaries and formally establish the district through Council action.  ·  Incentive Programs: To motivate property owners to utilize the business improvement concepts and ideas developed through the LiNC project, the project team is working on two programs for future implementation. These programs were debuted at the November 24, 2015 City Council meeting, and received direction to move forward.  Lincoln Blvd. Business Improvement Fund : in coordination with the City’s Economic Development division, staff is working to create a pilot program that supports small façade-improvement projects on private property on Lincoln Boulevard with nominal matching funds, perhaps no higher than $500 per tenant space.  Conceptually, Lincoln Boulevard businesses or property owners could apply for matching funds through an application that required 1) design details as required by standard permits, 2) enrollment in the City’s “Buy Local” program, and 3) matching dollars or sweat equity equal to or greater than the City’s maximum contribution. The results of the pilot program could be used as a case study to help encourage and inspire other property owners and businesses to undertake improvements with small budgets.  ·  Fee Suspension for Staff Level Architectural Review Board (ARB) Applications : many code violations or complaints about the Boulevard’s aesthetic stem from outdated or non-conforming building features, such as signage, paint and exterior treatments, and landscaping.  Many of these items require staff-level ARB approval, which carries a $350 fee that is an impediment to many Lincoln Boulevard businesses.  In coordination with the  Planning Department , staff could draft a Council resolution that, if adopted, could suspend ARB fees for staff-level approvals for a limited time, perhaps up to one year. During that period, staff would actively work with local businesses, code enforcement and other entities to address improvements on a case-by-case basis, gradually enhancing the corridor.  Handbooks: A great deal of work has been performed to create a vision for Lincoln Boulevard that cohesively blends streetscape improvements with private-property upgrades and investment in new uses. To support private property owners and businesses in participating in this large scale transformation, staff is developing a series of handbooks that provide illustrative guidance for:  ·  Adaptive Reuse: reuse of existing low-scale buildings to accommodate new or expanded uses without substantially altering the building envelope. ·  Change of Use: new pedestrian oriented uses that occupy former auto-oriented spaces. ·  New Construction: new infill projects that are compatible with the surrounding fabric and texture of Lincoln Boulevard. The handbooks are envisioned to provide concise information about best practices for creating a better pedestrian experience at human scale. This work will employ a graphic designer and a team of City staff to reduce bureaucratic language and process explanations into a user-friendly guide that will be provided to all businesses and property owners on the corridor. Environmental Analysis The LINC project is categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to Sections 15301, 15303, and 15304 of the CEQA Guidelines. ·  The project consists of alterations to existing Lincoln Boulevard and no expansion of roadway capacity is proposed.  Therefore, the project falls into the Class 1 exemption. Section 15301 of CEQA Guidelines provides (Class 1) exemption for the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agency's determination.  Projects that fall into this class of exemption include alterations to existing streets, sidewalks, gutter, bicycle facilities, and other similar facilities and additions of safety or health protection during for use in conjunction with existing facilities.    ·  The proposed LINC would construct new small facilities and structures including landscaped medians, curb extensions, curb ramps, crosswalk striping, pavement striping, pedestrian lighting, bike racks, benches, and wayfinding markings on existing Lincoln Boulevard. Section 15303 of CEQA Guidelines provides (Class 3) exemption for the construction and location of limited numbers of new small facilities or structures.   Projects that fall into this class of exemption include street improvements of reasonable length. Therefore, the project falls into the Class 3 exemption.  ·  The proposed LINC project would install new paving, pavement/crosswalk markings, and refreshed landscaping that would include new street trees, mulch, ground cover, or low water use plantings on Lincoln Boulevard. Section 15304 of CEQA Guidelines provides (Class 4) exemption for minor public or private alterations in the condition of land, water, and or vegetation which do not involve removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees.    Therefore, the project falls into the Class 4 exemption. In addition, none of the exceptions  specified in Section 15300.2 of CEQA Guidelines would preclude the use of these CEQA exemptions - The project site is not located in a sensitive environment, the  project will not have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances, the project would  not damage  scenic resources, the project would not be located on a hazardous waste site; and the project would not cause a change to a historical resource.  Therefore, this project is categorically exempt per Sections 15301, 15303, and 15304 of the CEQA Guidelines. Once Council approves the project, the design team will finalize the Streetscape Design and begin implementation of the project in accordance with the following timeline:  Spring/Summer 2017 – Dedicated Bus Lanes ·  Work on the Dedicated Bus Lane began in February of this year with formal outreach to the local business community.  Pending reaffirmation of the bus lane and parking restrictions by City Council, staff believes a dedicated bus lane facility could be installed as early as summer 2017.  Funding for this project has been made available through the CIP process. April 2017- January 2018 – Construction Documents for Phase 1 Implementation ·  Funding has been identified through the CIP process to fund construction documentation for Phase 1 implementation. T his CIP funding will be presented to Council for approval as part of the FY 2017-18 Capital Improvement Program budget, and will be used to  finance the creation of bidding documents that can be used to select a preferred contractor to build Phase 1 at a later date. January 2018- May 201 9 – Construction of Phase 1 Implementation ·  Funding has been identified for the cost of constructing Phase 1 , which will roll out over a period of approximately 12 months, though the community will begin to see improvements much sooner than the May 2019 completion date.  Public Works staff is assessing the possibility of an implementation sequence to address crosswalks in the short-term, with more construction heavy activities to follow. 	\N	5

29	Contractual Service Agreement for Plumbing Contractor Services	Public Works, Facilities Maintenance	The City contracts out plumbing work for various City facilities including office locations, park restrooms, city libraries, Annenberg Beach House and Santa Monica Municipal Airport properties.  Th is contracted work augments the City’s in-house plumbing team and is often focused on large - scale and/or urgent plumbing issues , which occur approximately 40 times per fiscal year . After a formal bid process , seeking up to two contractors and reviewing the four bids received, staff recommends a sp lit award for the two best bidders as follows : ·  Plumbing by Todd R. Marsh (TRM Services) would provi de large - scale repairs for one year, with two additional two -year renewal options for a cumulative not to exc eed amount of $ 1,040,808 over a five- year per iod. ·  Horn’s Backflow & Plumbing Service would provide minor urgent and after-hour repairs  for one year, with two additional two -year renewal options for a cumulative not to ex ceed amount of $225,000 over a five -year period. 	The City employs four permanent in-house plumbers, including one p lumber c rew l eader, to provide various plumbing servi ces at City facilities. Typical services provided by City staff include repairing drain line stoppages, repairing fixtures, replacing water filters, installing water heaters and performing tenant improvement projects.  This team, however, cannot handle all of the City’s plumbing needs and therefore historically has contracted out for additional plumbing services.  On January 13, 2015 (Attachment A), staff presented to Council a Contract and As-Needed Staffing Review: Policy, Pract ice, Recommendations report. Council approved contracted staff for plumbing services as part of the comprehensive report; plumbing services have not changed substantially since that analysis.  On June 23, 2015 (Attachment B) , Council authorized the City Manager to exercise the first year renewal option of Bid #4164 and execute a contractual service agreement with The Lighthart Corporation for plumbing contractor services in a t otal amount not to exceed  $550,000 over a three -year period that ended June 30, 2017. 	 While Facil ities Maintenance plumbing staff completes the majority of the plumbing work at City facilities, plumbing con tractor services are needed for urgent repairs and large -scale j obs that require the excavation of water and sewer lines or installation of new  fixtures s uch as drinking fountains, sinks , toilets, etc.  To ensure the City has access to the best pricing and to keep proposals competitive, staff recommend s splitting the award between TRM Services and Horn’s Backflow & Plumbing Service.  TRM Services w ould provide plumbing services for large - scale projects that are often long-term and require specialized licensing and equipment , such as boiler rehabilitations, water and sewer line replacements , and installation of plumbing fixtures .  Horn’s Backflow w ould provide plumbing services for minor urgent and after-hour repairs such as drain cleanouts, storm drain stoppages and fixture leaks .  Staff’s recommendation is to award the bid to two plumbing contractors to allow continuous and immediate availability as plumbing emergencies often involve sanitation and water supply issues, which directly impact public h ealth.  Vendor/Consultant Selection On May 9, 2017, the City published Notices Inviting Bids for citywide plumbing contractor services that included multi-year renewal options in accordance with City specifications. The bid was posted on the City's on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code Section 2.24.100(a) . A total of 20 vendors downloaded the bid. Four bids were received and publicly opened on May 25, 2017 , per Attachment C. B ids were evaluated based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, previous experience, ability to deliver, quality of product, and compliance wi th City specifications. Neither TRM Services n or Horn’s Backflow is the lowest bidder when considering the hourly labor rates , but both offered competitive pricing, the fastest guaranteed response times and lowest pricing for renewal options .  Moreover, both recommended bidders have previously provided the City with responsive and satisfactory service. Amgreen Solutions offered the lowest hourly labor rate, but its pricing is significantly lower than the established Prevailing Wage rates required by state law,  demonstrating non-compliance and thus its bid was inadmissible.  Based on these criteria, staff recommends TRM Services and Horn’s Backflow as the best bidders .  As both bid awards are subject to prevailing wage rates , the recommended cumulative not to exceed amount has increased from the previous contracted amount by approximately 30 percent. The cumulative not to exceed amount increas e is also attributed to the additional two-year renewal option.  	\N	6
30	Adoption of an Emergency Interim Ordinance to Authorize the Issuance of Additional Temporary Use Permits for Temporary Sidewalk Sales Undertaken in Conjunction with a City Public Street Event by Business Improvement Districts and Areas and by Businesses Located within a Seven Hundred Fifty Foot Radius of the City Event and Waiving the Filing Fee for Temporary Use Permits that Will Be Exercised During the City Public Street Event by These Entities	Development Review 2	On October 1, 2017, the City will celebrate its second Coast Festival – a City-produced Open Streets event to celebrate mobility, culture, and sustainability. The City is working closely with local businesses and neighborhood and community partners who have expressed the desire to undertake activities such as sidewalk and food/beverage sales in conjunction with the event.  The City’s Zoning Ordinance authorizes Temporary Use Permits (TUPs) for sidewalk sales. However, sidewalk sales located on the public right of way are limited to two events within any 12-month period, and Business Improvement Districts are limited to two such events within any 12-month period. Certain Business Improvement Districts will already reach this numerical limitation based on sidewalk sales events that have already been undertaken or will be undertaken apart from this City event.  In order to minimize the impacts that this public Coast event will have on businesses located within or near the event and to enable these businesses to undertake activities in conjunction with the event, it is necessary for the Council to enact this emergency interim ordinance to expand the frequency that temporary use permits may be obtained for sidewalk sales when these additional sales are undertaken in conjunction with a City-produced public street event and to waive the filing fee for temporary use permits sought in conjunction with this event. 	City Public Street Events are authorized pursuant to Administrative Instruction II-4-4 of the City’s Community Events Law. The one-day Coast event will allow pedestrian and bicycle access to streets free of automobiles with activity hubs along the route and will extend approximately 2.5 miles encompassing portions of Main Street, Colorado Avenue, Ocean Avenue, and the Third Street Promenade. The event will focus on sustainable mobility while incorporating art, culture, and environmental learning opportunities throughout.  The City is working closely with local businesses and neighborhood and community partners to ensure favorable and mutually beneficial outcomes from the Coast event. Businesses located along and close to the Coast event route depend on street access and accessibility to public parking for their employees and customers .  Businesses located on the streets encompassed within this event or within close proximity to the event have expressed concern about the impact the event will have on their businesses given the significant reduction in automobile traffic that will be allowed and the fact that certain streets and public parking lots in the area will become wholly inaccessible to vehicles. These businesses have also expressed the desire to undertake activities such as sidewalk and food/beverage sales in conjunction with the event.  The inaugural COAST Festival took place in 2016 with Council adopting a similar emergency interim ordinance to the one proposed (Attachment B). Following the COAST Festival, a survey was administered to all businesses along the COAST route and to those that participated in conjunction with the event. The overall feedback was positive as the businesses appreciated the increased exposure during the event and expressed their desire to participate in more events in the future. 	The City’s Zoning Ordinance authorizes Temporary Use Permits for sidewalk sales ; h owever, pursuant to Santa Monica Municipal Code (SMMC) Section 9.31.370(B)(2)(d), businesses are limited to four such events within any 12-month period, except sidewalk sales located on the public right of way are limited to two events within any 12-month period. The Zoning Ordinance also authorizes Business Improvements Districts and Areas to undertake a maximum of two sidewalk sales located on the public right of way within any 12-month period. In establishing these limitations, the City did not contemplate this type of City-produced Coast event and its associated impacts and opportunities for business participation. Certain Business Improvements Districts will already reach this numerical limitation based on sidewalk sales events that have already been undertaken or will be undertaken apart from this City event. The City’s Zoning Ordinance also authorizes TUPs for fairs, festivals, or similar compatible temporary uses.  In order to minimize the impacts that this Coast event will have on businesses located within or near the event and to enable these businesses to undertake activities in conjunction with the event, it is necessary for the Council to enact this emergency interim ordinance to expand the frequency that TUPs may be obtained for sidewalk sales when these additional sales are undertaken in conjunction with a City-produced public street event and to waive the filing fee for TUPs sought in conjunction with this event. The current filing fee for a TUP application is $1,508.79.  As proposed in the Interim Ordinance, the issuance of a TUP for a sidewalk sale by a Business Improvement District or Area that is geographically located, in whole or in part, within the parameters of a City Public Street Event authorized pursuant to Administrative Instruction II-4-4 of the City’s Community Events Law or by any business not within business improvement districts and areas but located within a 750 foot radius of the City Public Street Event and that will be exercised contemporaneous with and in conjunction with the City Public Street Event would not count towards the TUP numerical limitation established in SMMC Section 9.31.370(B)(2)(d). In addition, no filing fee would be required for any TUP sought by a Business Improvement District or Area that is geographically located within the parameters of a City Public Street Event authorized pursuant to Administrative Instruction II-4-4 or by any business located within business improvement districts and areas but located within a 750 - foot radius of the City Public Street Event and that will be exercised contemporaneous with and in conjunction with the City Public Street Event. This Interim Ordinance will be effective immediately and shall be of no further force or effect sixty days after its adoption, unless prior to that date, after a public hearing, noticed pursuant to Santa Monica Municipal Code Section 9.37.050, the City Council, by majority vote, extends this interim ordinance  Adoption of the Emergency Interim Ordinance would minimize any potential adverse impacts to businesses created by the Coast event and allow for increased community and business participation in this unique, one-day event. 	\N	6

35	Proposed Revisions to Housing Trust Fund Guidelines	Housing Division, Housing and Economic Development	\N	Santa Monica has a long history of leadership in Southern California for championing housing affordability. V oter-approved affordable housing goals are achieved through a variety of City policies, including rent control, zoning regulations such as the Affordable Housing Production Program, as well as investments in the production and preservation of affordable housing via the City’s housing trust funds. Prior to 1998, staff administered five different affordable housing trust funds, each with separate guidelines involving eligibility requirements, loan terms, and other conditions, creating complexity and inconsistency amongst the funds. On November 24, 1998 (Attachment B), City Council approved consolidation of the various trust fund guidelines into a single set covering all of the housing trust funds. Since 1998, City Council has revisited and amended the Guidelines on five occasions to reflect updated market conditions and best practices. The current Guidelines establish uniform loan terms and conditions among the five trust funds, while recognizing unique eligibility requirements, where applicable, based upon each trust fund revenue source. Prior to the State-mandated dissolution of redevelopment agencies in 2012, the City’s redevelopment tax increment revenue was the primary local funding source for the production and preservation of affordable housing in Santa Monica. Such funding amounted to approximately $15 million annually and financed affordable housing through loans to nonprofit housing organizations. In November 2016, Santa Monica voters approved Measures GS and GSH, which together create a new source of locally  controlled revenue and direct one-half of the revenue toward affordable housing purposes. The new tax  is expected to generate approximately $8 million annually. In addition, Council dedicated proceeds from the repayment of City loan s to the former Redevelopment Agency,  toward affordable housing .  Proceeds are estimated to average approximately $8 million annually for the next seven years. The Housing Commission’s review of the Guidelines evaluated whether amendments are warranted. Prior to forming recommendations, the Commission sought public comment on the existing Guidelines by proactively contacting the City’s established neighborhood groups, as well as other stakeholders. Additionally, notice seeking public comment was published on the Housing Division’s website. Commissioners requested comments on the following items: (1) s pecific guidelines for a “Redevelopment Replacement Housing Trust Fund” (involving the new voter-approved funding and any General Funds allocated by Council from RDA loan repayments); (2) g eneral guidelines applicable to all h ousing t rust f unds; (3) p lanning and r eporting procedures; and (4) the d ecision-making process for approving affordable housing loans.  Written responses from 16 individuals and organizations were received and considered by the Housing Commission (Attachment C). 	A three-member subcommittee of Housing Commissioners reviewed the Guidelines and presented a draft report (Attachment D) with recommendations to the Housing Commission on May 18, 2017. The subcommittee report recommended the following to City Council: (1) Creation of a new “Redevelopment Replacement Housing Trust Fund”; (2) Public planning and reporting on all Housing Trust Funds; (3) Increased transparency regarding approved loans, trust fund balances, and uses of funds; and (4) Limited changes to the loan-approval process. The Commission discussed the draft report, approved minor revisions, and adopted the final report (Attachment E). Each section below includes the Housing Commission’s recommendations to City Council, followed by staff’s identification of any legal or administrative issues associated with the proposed revisions to the Guidelines. Creation of a New Housing Trust Fund Currently, the scope of the Guidelines includes five existing h ousing t rust f unds , as follows : (1)  Citywide Housing Trust Fund (2)  Redevelopment Housing Trust Fund (3)  HOME Housing Trust Fund (4)  CDBG Housing Trust Fund (5)  TORCA Housing Trust Fund  The Housing Commission recommends the creation of a new, sixth h ousing t rust f und called “Redevelopment Replacement Housing Trust Fund” (RRHTF) containing revenue from 50% of the Measure GSH transaction and use tax and G eneral F unds allocated annually by Council, initially derived from the former Redevelopment Agency (RDA) loan repayments . Establishing a new and separate housing trust fund  is intended to provide transparency regarding tracking, expenditure, and use of the funds  delineated through  a reserve account in the Special Revenue Source Fund. General Funds include dedicated funds from the June 14, 2016 City Council meeting in  which City Council directed staff to set aside the RDA loan repayments for affordable housing (Attachment F) . The Housing Commission also recommends specific requirements and eligible uses to ensure funds meet the City’s priority affordable housing needs. The Housing Commission recommend s a three-prong ed approach for the RRHTF that seeks to 1) increase affordable housing opportunities with new construction, 2) preserve existing affordable housing with acquisition and rehabilitation, and 3) prevent displacement of low-income households with rental - subsidy programs. One key recommendation is targeting the funding to households with incomes at or below 80 percent of area median income. Another recommendation is that proposed eligible uses include both new construction and acquisition and rehabilitation developments, noting that new construction has historically achieved better leveraging of public and private financing, thereby minimizing City subsidies and maximizing the reach of City housing trust funds. Finally, the Housing Commission recommends that the eligible uses of the RRHTF allow for rental - subsidy programs, subject to Council approval regarding specific programs. With respect to eligible borrowers, and consistent with current Housing Trust Fund Guidelines policy, the Housing Commission also recommends that eligibility for the new trust fund be limited to nonprofit affordable housing organizations and limited partnerships with a nonprofit general partner. In summary, the Housing Commission recommends: ·  Creation of a new housing trust fund (“Redevelopment Replacement Housing Trust Fund”) for revenue received from Measure GSH and any matching funds allocated by Council; and  ·  Guidelines for the new housing trust fund establishing: o  Eligible uses include affordable housing created through new construction and acquisition/rehabilitation, as well as rental subsidies, if a specific program is approved by Council  o  Funds be targeted to households with incomes at or below 80 percent of area median income; and  o  Eligible borrowers must be nonprofit housing organizations. One area of clarification involves the requirement, pursuant to State law, that 20 percent of any loan payments from the former RDA to the City be deposited into a ‘Low-Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund’ (LMIHAF). The existing Redevelopment Housing Trust Fund (RHTF) serves as the LMIHAF and is subject to specific regulatory restrictions regarding eligible uses and affordability targeting. Therefore, staff recommends continuing to direct 80 percent of RDA loan repayments to the RRHTF , which is subject to local discretion only, and 20 percent to the existing RHTF, in order to facilitate the appropriate use, tracking, reporting, and compliance associated with th e affordable housing revenue. Additionally, to avoid confusion between the existing RHTF and the proposed RRHTF , staff recommends renaming the existing RHTF to the “Low-Moderate Income Housing Asset Trust Fund” (LMIHATF) . Public Planning and Reporting Procedures for All Housing Trust Funds The Housing Commission recommends establishing housing trust fund priorities aligned with the adopted Housing Element’s affordable housing production goals. Under California law, the City is required to periodically prepare a Housing Element which must be approved by the State. The City’s current Housing Element covers the period from 2014 through 2021 and includes ‘Quantified Objectives’ for housing production based on the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (the RHNA is conducted by the Southern California Association of Governments). Quantified Objectives established in the Housing Element already provide a guide as to affordability level (extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income) goals. To inform priorities for housing trust funds allocations, the Housing Commission recommends aligning with the Housing Element planning cycle and using that process to refine affordable housing production goals with respect to housing type (family, senior, special needs, etc.) and size (bedroom mix). In addition to achieving harmony among affordable housing production policy and housing trust fund priorities, the Housing Commission aims to ensure transparency and accountability regarding the use of all housing trust funds.  Therefore, the Commission recommends the following planning, public input, and reporting procedures be included in the Housing Trust Fund Guidelines: ·  Staff shall prepare a proposed Initial Plan for affordable housing development for the remaining period covered by the current Housing Element (i.e., though 2021);  ·  Staff shall make the proposed initial plan  available online , for a 45-day period for written public comment, and hold a public hearing (which staff recommends be hosted by the Housing Commission) between the 30 th and 45 th day of the comment period (to receive additional/final public comment);  ·  Proposed initial plan shall be submitted with public comment to the Housing Commission for review and advisory recommendations, and then to the Council for consideration and approval;  ·  Annually thereafter, the Housing Division shall submit a report to the Housing Commission, along with any proposed amendments to the Council-adopted initial plan, detailing the following information:  (1)   source and amount of funds received into each housing trust fund during the prior year;  (2)   amount and uses of funds expended from each housing trust fund during the prior year;  (3)   quantity and type of affordable housing made available for occupancy during the prior year;  (4)   quantity and type of affordable housing which exceeded or fell below the annual production mandate of Proposition R during the prior year;  (5)   cumulative figures of source/amount of housing trust funds, quantity/type of affordable housing made available, and exceeded/missed Proposition R requirement, covering the Housing Element period, as well as a comparison with the Quantified Objectives set forth in the Housing Element; and  (6)   comparison of the actual cumulative affordable housing production covering the period of the adopted Initial Plan with the goals set forth in that plan.  One clarification staff recommends is that the annual report information described in Item 2 above also include the amount and source of funding commitments issued during the prior year.  Such information will make clear the resulting unencumbered trust fund balances available at the end of each reporting period. Increasing Transparency for All Housing Trust Funds The Housing Commission recommends several measures to provide easy and prompt access to housing trust fund information. These include online posting, automated email notification to the public, and public meetings regarding loan commitments. For online postings, the Commission recommends that information be available in one online location, clearly identified as “Housing Trust Funds” on the Housing Division website, and include the following relevant information within one week of becoming public: (1)  current Housing Trust Funds Guidelines;  (2)  all documents generated and made public by the City Manager, the Housing Division, the Housing Commission, and the City Council pursuant to the affordable housing planning and reporting process;  (3)  written explanation of the City’s decisions to approve or reject applications;  (4)  all loan commitment letters issued;  (5)  all notices of the required public meeting following a loan commitment; and  (6)  all annual reports provided by the Housing Trust Fund recipients (redacted for privacy).  Another measure the Housing Commission recommends is the creation of an automated notification service whereby members of the public can register to receive emails when new housing trust fund information (as described above) is posted on the website. Furthermore, the Housing Commission recommends that loan commitment recipients hold a public meeting about the associated affordable housing.  The public meeting must occur within 30 days of the loan commitment, and the recipient must provide a document giving notice of the date, time and location of the public meeting to the Housing Division at least 15 days prior to the public meeting date. One clarification staff recommends is that the posting of information described in Items 1-6 above be applied prospectively, given the 30-year history of housing trust fund loans.  Revisions to Loan Approval Process Current Guidelines prescribe an administrative process for the review and approval of loan applications involving both new construction and acquisition/rehabilitation affordable housing developments. The process has proven effective in creating affordable housing for families, individuals, seniors, persons living with disabilities, and persons experiencing homelessness.  Administrative loan approval allows applicants to be competitive in the Santa Monica marketplace, where property acquisition opportunities suitable for affordable housing are sporadic and highly competitive .  The  loan application and approval process includes these components: ·  Loan application submitted (applicant) ·  Due diligence and underwriting (City and applicant and other public/private lenders/investors) ·  Loan Committee Report issued w/recommendations (City) ·  Loan Committee meeting – approve/deny loan (City) ·  Loan Commitment letter issued with conditions for final loan approval (City) ·  Loan Documents preparation, review, negotiation, and execution (City and applicant and other public/private lenders/investors) ·  Escrow closing/property acquisition (City and applicant and other public/private lenders/investors)  Historically, only nonprofit affordable housing organizations and partnerships have applied for housing trust fund loans, although two of the five existing housing trust funds allow for-profit applicants. Long-standing protocol requires that staff prepare an internal Loan Committee Report which provides an overview of the proposed affordable housing, target population, affordability levels, sources and uses of funds including any proposed vouchers from the Housing Authority, due diligence conclusions, and the general basis for recommending approval (or denial) of the proposed affordable housing loan. To increase transparency and document in detail the rationale regarding the decision-making aspect of the loan approval process, the Housing Commission recommends that staff prepare and make public a written statement explaining the reasons for approving or denying a loan request.  The written statement should address the merits of the loan application evaluated under the criteria enumerated in the Guidelines: ·  Significantly increase affordable housing opportunities for households who have difficulty finding housing including the homeless, large families, the disabled, seniors, and persons traditionally served by Single-Room Occupancy housing ·  Are cost-effective or achieve the lowest possible subsidy per unit for City/Agency resources ·  Benefit a high percentage of very low- and low-income households by ensuring deeper affordability ·  Are located in areas currently underserved by affordable housing developments ·  Address an area of need identified in the Housing Element of the City of Santa Monica The Housing Commission further recommends that two additional criteria be included to evaluate a loan application and addressed in the written statement: ·  Whether the proposed affordable housing addresses a particular need identified in the Council-approved Initial Plan (described earlier in this report); and ·  Applicant’s past and projected effectiveness implementing the City-established local preferences (i.e., households that live or work in Santa Monica). The practical effect of evaluating an applicant’s effectiveness in achieving the City’s local preference goals c ould favor housing providers who administer their wait ing lists in a manner where only households who live or work in Santa Monica are beneficiaries of City-funded affordable housing. The Housing Commission also recommends the Guidelines be revised to clarify that a commitment letter issued by the City shall be signed by the Housing Division Manager and the Director of Housing and Economic Development (a protocol which has been in practice for years). Furthermore, at its May 18, 2017 meeting, the Housing Commission appointed a two-member subcommittee to observe the loan approval decision-making process to facilitate a future discussion regarding other possible recommended changes to the Guidelines. Staff will coordinate with the subcommittee to assist them in achieving familiarity with the details of the loan approval process. Of final note is the Housing Commission’s recommendation regarding the loan approval process as it relates to the intersection of public input and compliance with fair housing law s . The Commission report notes that a significant portion of public comment (about possible revisions to the existing Guidelines) involves a recent housing trust fund loan for affordable housing targeted to persons living with disabilities. Concerned that the City should tread cautiously to avoid creating impediments to fair housing  (e.g., like imposing a requirement on the developer to conduct a public meeting after a loan commitment has been issued) while simultaneously establishing policies for robust public input regarding affordable housing spending priorities, the Commission recommends, “that City Council direct the City Attorney to ‘ review existing guidelines and procedures and provide legal advice regarding whether any changes are appropriate .’”  Accordingly, the City Attorney’s Office will review the Guidelines for fair housing compliance and staff will return to Council with amendments , if warranted.  Maximum Loan and Developer Fee Limits The maximum housing trust fund loan (and grant) limits pursuant to the current Guidelines are established on a per-unit basis and adjusted annually based upon a Council-approved methodology linked to changes in land and construction costs (see Municipal Code Section 9.64.070{b}).  The FY201 7 -1 8 limits are illustrated in the table below: Fiscal Year 201 7 -1 8   $ 492,848 $ 613,710 $ 518,363 $ 645,940  Loans in excess of the maximum (per-unit) amounts must be approved by the City Council, as well as loans involving more than 50 residences. The Housing Commission noted that the combination of the two limits (a per-unit loan limit and a 50-unit loan limit) results in substantial administrative authority for loan approval. In that context, the Commission recommends revising the Guidelines to include an aggregate loan/grant limit of $15 million per affordable housing development. Any loan/grant exceeding $15 million would require City Council approval. The proposed $15 million aggregate loan limit raises a few issues.  One issue involves a potential disconnect between proprietary and regulatory policies intended to facilitate affordable housing. Since 2005, the Guidelines have included the 50-residence loan limit for affordable housing funding. Similarly, the zoning code provides for administrative approval of affordable housing developments containing 50 residences or fewer . ( On Ju ly 11, 2017, City Council endorsed a final draft Downtown Community Plan which  would allow administrative approval for a ffordable housing developments.) Revising the current Guidelines to add a $15 million loan limit could result in misalignment of streamlining measures for affordable housing development. For example, a proposed affordable housing development involving 45 residences with an average loan subsidy of $350,000 per residence would require Council approval (45 x $350,000 = $15,750,000) , though the housing would not require discretionary approvals.   An additional challenge is that competing for other financing to leverage City funds (such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits) cannot occur until all discretionary approvals are obtained, which can create delays in proposed housing, given application periods are limited to once or twice year.  With respect to preservation of existing housing through acquisition and rehabilitation, the proposed $15 million loan limit could limit such opportunities to properties with less than 28 residences , given that recent City loans have average d $550,000 per residence ($550,000 x 28 = $15,400,000) , as sellers may be reluctant to accept purchase offers subject to Council approval. Finally, the Housing Commission’s report notes that public comment received involved the issue of increasing the developer fee limit.  The ‘base limit’ amount allowed for the developer fee was last established for the fiscal 2007-08 period, although the amount is adjusted annually per the Guidelines. The Commission did not have adequate opportunity to study and evaluate the issue of developer fee limits, but intends to consider the matter in the future and make a recommendation to Council.  Next Steps An additional issue staff would like to address which was not part of the Housing Commission report involves updating the sustainability goals in affordable housing which would be eligible for financing by housing trust funds (see Exhibit D of the Guidelines, “Green Affordable Housing Checklist”). Staff will collaborate with the City’s Office of Sustainability and the Environment to prepare recommended updates to Exhibit D, seeking a balance between integrating effective (and required) sustainability features, recognizing the cost-effectiveness thresholds of other public funding programs, and requiring leveraging from federal/state/local sustainability programs where available.  Staff would review with the Housing Commission any proposed changes to Exhibit D, and then return t o Council with recommendations. Summary The following table summarizes the proposed revisions to the Housing Trust Fund Guidelines:  ·  Creation of new Housing Trust Fund for Measure GSH revenues and matching G eneral F unds allocated by Council ·  Targeting households with incomes at or below 80 percent of Area Median Income. ·  Eligible Uses includes new construction, acquisition and rehabilitation, and Council-approved rental subsidy programs. ·  Eligible borrowers must be nonprofit housing organizations and partnerships with a nonprofit general partner. ·  Alignment of Housing Trust Fund priorities with the adopted Housing Element’s affordable housing production goals. ·  Planning, public input, and reporting procedures tied to the Housing Element cycle. ·  Housing Trust Funds annual report. ·  One online location identified as “Housing Trust Funds” ·  All relevant information available online. ·  Automated notification service for members of the public. ·  Written statement explaining reasons for approving or denying a loan request. ·  Two additional criteria be included to evaluate a loan application ·  Commitment letter be signed by the Housing Manager and the Director of Housing and Economic Development. ·  City Council approval required for any loan and or grant exceeding $15 million ·  Staff will collaborate with the City’s Office of Sustainability and the Environment to update Exhibit D of the Housing Trust Funds Guidelines. 	\N	7
36	Hold Public Hearings for Streetlight Assessment District A, District B, and District C	Public Works, Civil Engineering	S uccessful petitions to initiate the formation of streetlight assessment district s  were received from t he residents and property owners of three separate districts: 1 0 th Street between Carlyle A venue and  M arguerita Avenue (District A) ; 25 th Street between Idaho Avenue and Washington Avenue (District B) ; and 27 th Street between Pico Boulevard and Pearl Street (District “C”). T he se petition s w ere accepted and resolutions of intent were approved by City Council  on April 18, 2017. Notices, preliminary assessment amounts, and ballots regarding the proposed assessment district s were sent to the property owners  of each district as required by State law , under the Municipal Improvement Act of 1911 (1911 Act). The 1911 Act also requires City Council to hold a public hearing for each proposed district to hear any objections and protests to the proposed assessment s . At the conclusion of the three public hearing s , the City Clerk  will tabulate the  submitted assessment ballots of each district , tally the votes , and present the results at the August  8 , 20 17 Council Meeting. I f a majority of property owners  in a district vote s in favor of the ir assessment , a streetlight assessment district is formed .  No assessment is imposed without majority support . No budget action is required at this time. 	New streetlight assessment districts in residential areas begin by petition, submitted by the residents and/or property owners in accordance with Santa Monica Municipal Code section 7.04.860 . The process for creating a new streetlight district and imposing assessments must comply with Proposition 218  (Prop 218) and the 1911 Act . Should any of the district s pass by a majority of property owners’ vote , each of the properties within the proposed assessment district would be assessed the amount that is direct ly proportion al to the special benefit received. Under the California Constitution Article XIIID Section 4, each parcel’s assessment may not exceed the reasonable , proportional cost of the special benefit for each property. 	 On April 18, 2017, City Council accepted petition s for 10 th Street between Carlyle Avenue and Marguerita Avenue (District A), 25 th Street between Idaho Avenue and Washington Avenue (District B) , and 27 th Street between Pico Boulevard and Pearl Street (District C) , approved the Preliminary Engineer’s Report s , and approved the resolution s of intent to set the pub lic hearing s , per Attachment A . Notices were mailed to property owners in accordance with Prop 218 , along with a ballot for the purpose of voting for or against the ir assessment.  All property assess ments for street lighting are based on the Preliminary Engineer’s Report s. A separate Preliminary Engineer’s Report was prepared for each proposed district . Estimated maximum assessment amounts were included with each mailed packet.  The City Clerk must receive completed ballots  from property owners prior to the close of the public hearing s . At each hearing, City Council will listen to any objections and protests to the proposed assessment s . At the conclusion of each of the public hearing s , the assessment ballots submitted in support of and in opposition to the proposed assessment for each district would be tabulated. No assessment would be imposed if there were a majority protest. A majority protest exists  if, upon the conclusion of each hearing, ballots submitted in opposition to the assessment exceed the ballots submitted in favor of the assessment. Tabulation of the assessment ballots are weighted according to the amount of the proposed assessment on the property related to that b allot . The City Clerk’s office will tally the votes and present the results at the August 8, 2017 Council Meeting.  At the continued Council meeting on August 8, 2017, Council would accept the certified results of the district election s as tabulated by the City Clerk. Should the results be in favor of one or more of the assessment district s , staff would begin a formal bidding process to select a contractor to furnish and install new streetlight s  and return to Council to award a construction contract. 	\N	7
40	Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule: July 2017 through June 2018 and Administrative Budgets	Housing and Economic Development	The Redevelopment Successor Agency is required to prepare r ecognized o bligation p ayment s chedules (ROPS) and corresponding administrative budgets to be implemented in yearly increments. In November 2016, the Agency submitted a last and final ROPS to the California Department of Finance.  The last and final ROPS includes all anticipated Agency obligations through 2042, when all obligations will be retired.  However, the Department of Finance has not yet approved the last and final ROPS, requiring the Agency to submit an annual  ROPS for Fiscal Year 17-18 by February 1, 2017. 	Under the governing statutes  that implemented the dissolution of redevelopment agencies statewide, each redevelopment successor agency is required to prepare a r ecognized o bligation p ayment s chedule (ROPS) on a yearly basis. The ROPS identifies a former r edevelopment a gency’s enforceable obligations and sources of payment for those obligations. Each successor agency is required to submit an approved ROPS to the California Department of Finance and the relevant c ounty a uditor- c ontroller for the period ending June 30, 2018 (ROPS 17-18) by February  1,  2017.  On November 1, 2016, the Santa Monica Redevelopment Successor Agency Board (Agency) approved a last and final ROPS (Last and Final ROPS) for submittal to the Agency’s Oversight Board as a final step in the process of dissolving the Agency.  The  Last and Final ROPS was approved by the Agency’s Oversight Board on November 14, 2016. The Oversight Board-approved Last and Final ROPS was then submitted to the Department of Finance on November 16, 2016.  Under SB 107, the California Department of Finance has 100 days to review and approve the Last and Final ROPS. In order to ensure that the Agency’s FY 2017-18 enforceable obligations are paid in the event that the Last and Final ROPS is not approved by February 1, 2017 , staff has prepared a concurrent annual ROPS for fiscal period 2017-18 and corresponding administrative budget that will be submitted to the Department of Finance and the Los Angeles County Auditor-Controller for their review and approval . 	 The ROPS 17-18 for the period of July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 includes Successor Agency e nforceable obligations within the following categories: 1) bond payments; 2)  indebtedness obligations (including loans, housing agreements, and similar obligations); 3) contracts or agreements necessary for continued administration or operation of Agency; and 4) Agency administrative cost allowance. All proposed ROPS  17-18 enforceable obligations have been previously listed and approved for payment on a previous ROPS. Under AB 26 and SB 107, the Agency may receive an administrative cost allowance of up to three percent of the property tax allocated to the Agency each fiscal year, based upon an approved administrative budget which justifies the administrative cost allowance. Based on last fiscal year’s property tax allocation to the Agency, the admin cost allowance cap for fiscal year 2017-18 would be $787,523.  The $775,650 administrative budget has been prepared so that the administrative cost allowance authorized under ROPS 17-18 will reimburse the Agency for expenses associated with implementing the Agency’s duties under the redevelopment dissolution statutes . The administrative budget is included as an enforceable obligation on the ROPS 17-18 (see Attachment A, Exhibit 1, Line Item 30).  The proposed ROPS 17-18 also seeks prepayment of a Wells Fargo loan during the first fiscal period (July 2017 through December 2017), when approximately $12.8 million of the Wells Fargo loan principal will be outstanding.  The loan can be prepaid at any time without penalty. The prepayment of the loan would result in estimated savings of approximately $192,000 in future interest costs.  Per State law, the savings would be apportioned between the various taxing entities within the project area, including the  City.  If the Last and Final ROPS is approved by the DOF after the item is considered by Council but before the Oversight Board meeting scheduled for January 18 , 2017, the  Oversight Board meeting will be cancelled and the Last and Final ROPS will take precedence.  With Agency board approval, s taff will forward the Agency-approved ROPS 17-18 to the Los Angeles County Auditor-Controller for review after approval by Oversight Board. Copies of the ROPS 17-18, as approved by the Oversight Board, will also be sent to the State Controller’s Office and the Department of Finance and posted on the Agency’s website no later than February 1, 2017. The Department of Finance must make its determination regarding the ROPS 17-18 no later than April 15, 2017. 	\N	8

44	Resolution of the Santa Monica Public Financing Authority Establishing Regular Meeting Dates	Finance Department	Effective January 1, 2010, Section 6592.1 was added to the California Government Code requiring that “A resolution authorizing bonds or any issuance of bonds or accepting the benefit of any bonds or the proceeds of bonds shall be adopted by an authority only during a regular meeting he ld pursuant to Section 54954.”  On May 10, 20 11 , the Board of Directors (the Board) of the Santa Monica Public Financing Authority (the Authority) established a regular meeting to be held on the fourth Tuesday of every May on the same date and time as a regular meeting of the City Council of the City.  On October 11, 2011 , the Board established a second regularly scheduled meeting to be held on the fourth Tuesday of October.  Staff recommends changing the meeting date s to be the same dates on which the City Council  meets.   This meeting schedule revision will allow the Authority to authorize bond issuance at a regularly scheduled meeting and thus meet the requirements of Section 6592.1 of the California Government Code.   However, i f an agenda for any regular meeting of the Board is not posted at least 72 hours before the meeting, the meeting will be deemed cancelled. 	On Jul y 25, 1995 , as authorized by Resolution No. 8923(CCS), the Santa Monica Public Financing Authority was organized pursuant to applicable provisions of the California Government Code Section 6500 et seq., and a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement, dated July 25, 1995, by and between the City and the Redevelopment Agency of the City of Santa Monica.  The purpose of the Authority is to provide financing for its members or other local public agencies in connection with the acquisition, construction and improvement of public capital improvements, working capital requirements , or liability or other insurance needs of its m embers or other local agencies.  The Redevelopment Dissolution Law (at Health & Safety Section 34178 (b)(3)) specifically provides that joint powers agreements in which the former Redevelopment Agency is a member of the joint powers authority (JPA) remain valid and bind the successor agency, subject to the constraints on the successor agency under the Redevelopment Dissolution Law, which effectively means that the JPA cannot use its authority to use tax increment as a means of financing and that action by the Successor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency, such as its approval of an amendment to the joint powers agreement, is subject to the terms of Redevelopment Dissolution Law.  The current recommended actions, however, are not constrained by the Redevelopment Dissolution Law.  Therefore, no action is required by the Successor Agency as a condition to the recommended actions. 	 Effective January 1, 2010, Section 6592.1 was added to the California Government Code requiring that “A resolution authorizing bonds or any issuance of bonds or accepting the benefit of any bonds or the proceeds of bonds shall be adopted by an authority only during a regular meeting held pursuant to Section 54954.”  Section 3.04 of the current Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement provides that “if the Board decides to hold regular meetings, such regular meetings shall be held at such time as the Board of Directors may fix by resolution from time to time.”  The attached Resolution sets the date and time of the Authority’s regular meeting to be the same dates on which the City Council meets. If an agenda for any regular meeting of the Board is not posted at least 72 hours before the meeting, the meeting will be deemed cancelled.  This change will eliminate the need for the Board to continue to adopt resolutions to adjust meeting dates to meet each specific bond financing schedule. 	\N	9
45	Council review and comment on Vision Zero, Bike Action Plan and Pedestrian Action Plan implementation.	Mobility (PCD)	\N	At the February 14, 2017, City Council Meeting, Council instructed staff to prepare a report documenting the progress of several initiatives, including the Pedestrian Action Plan, Bicycle Action Plan, and Vision Zero. The report took on greater urgency when the City experienced a cluster of vehicle/pedestrian collisions that resulted in severe injuries and, for some of the victims, death.  Santa Monica is generally, and rightfully, considered a very safe city, and the incidents caused consternation and dismay among residents, City staff, and the City Council. To address those concerns in the context of the initiatives referenced above, the City Manager encouraged staff from the Mobility Division and the SMPD to look deeper into data collected by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and the SMPD related to traffic collisions within our borders.  The Data  SMPD’s Traffic Enforcement Unit, a subsection of the Strategic Services Division, completed a survey of data related to traffic collisions that occurred on City roadways from January 2013 to April 2017. The Traffic Enforcement Unit examined all traffic related incidents involving vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, and motorcycles, and the primary collision factors associated with each collision. SMPD utilizes these statistics to determine the most efficient deployment of police education and enforcement resources, with the ultimate goal of reducing traffic collisions and achieving Vision Zero.  T he Mobility Division culled information from the CHP database, and combined that with statistics from the SMPD, to create several charts and graphs studying trends in City traffic collisions.  The current and potential uses for this data include (1) increasing safety and safety-awareness for drivers, riders, and pedestrians; (2) identifying, if possible, any patterns or behaviors that might be made safer; (3) testing the most appropriate metrics to quantify safety on City roadways; and (4) using the data to inform concerned citizens that Santa Monica continues to be a safe place to ride, walk, and drive.  The Goals and Plans Council’s adoption of Establishing a New Model for Mobility as a strategic goal is consistent with the City’s proactive and on-going work on mobility policy, programs and implementation. The Mobility Strategic Goal encourages people to use diverse and growing mobility options. Vision Zero is one of the three preliminary targets for the Mobility Strategic Goal, along with increasing the use of walking, biking, transit and shared rides, and the creation of a complete mobility network that supports the whole trip and multiple user needs. Financial resources were allocated in FY15-16 to jump-start projects such as the Downtown Crosswalk Scrambles and outreach for Expo Light Rail/GoSaMo. Strategic Goal outcomes are being integrated into the emerging citywide performance management framework.  Santa Monica’s Pedestrian Action Plan, adopted in February, 2016, is a citywide policy document that provides a focused evaluation of walking in Santa Monica, and outlines specific actions that improve the conditions and comfort for people walking. It builds upon the vision of the 2010 Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) as well as the Sustainable City Plan.  The Pedestrian Action Plan was generated from community input, detailed data analysis, and interdepartmental collaboration among the Police, Community and Cultural Services, Public Works and Planning and Community Development Departments. It is based on detailed analysis of many factors, including where pedestrian demand is highest, where pedestrian facilities could be improved, and where pedestrian collisions occurred over an 11-year period. It forecasted changes in pedestrian demand due to Expo Light Rail. The Pedestrian Action Plan includes a target for reducing and ultimately eliminating fatal and severe roadway collisions, internationally known as “Vision Zero,” a priority expressed by Council in March 2015.  The Bike Action Plan was adopted in November 2011, to guide City efforts to get people onto bikes, to promote safe bicycling, to encourage effective collaboration with community partners, and to help the City compete successfully for grant funding. The Bike Action Plan called for an increase in bicycling from 3% of trips to 14-35% by 2030. The Plan outlined five- and twenty-year goals for implementation of programs (education, awareness, events, and enforcement), creating support facilities (bike parking, bike centers), and construction/improvement of bikeways. With aggressive mode share targets, the Plan sought to make bicycling fun for everyone, as well as convenient and comfortable through a range of physical facilities and activities. The Bike Action Plan was the first implementation effort of the LUCE focused on creating complete streets that welcome pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders and drivers.   Discussion  Each year since 2013 staff has prepared a Bike Action Plan implementation report for the Planning Commission. This year a joint report on the Pedestrian and Bike Action Plans was prepared and presented with an overall mobility update at the March 1, 2017 meeting (see Attachment A). With the opening of Expo Light Rail, the Colorado Esplanade and California Incline, service changes from Big Blue Bus and growth of Breeze Bike Share ,  there was a lot to report. Pursuit of the Council’s Strategic Goal for a new model of mobility along with continued implementation of plans and projects brought a new enthusiasm for mobility and particularly bicycling and walking citywide.  Important as this Strategic Goal is to the Council and the community, it is one of many competing for capital investment, staff time and public engagement.  There are vocal advocates for each mode of transportation (including, especially , the automobile).  Remaking the street network to equalize access and promote shared usage and safety requires not only substantial financial commitment, but equally substantial commitment to ongoing management, public engagement and education -- as well as the political will to take the long view of change in the face of vigorous defense of the status quo when it comes to street design, parking policy and traffic enforcement.  So far in 2017, Santa Monica has seen an unusual spike in pedestrian-involved collisions. Some have resulted in severe injury and fatality. When a person is killed or severely injured it affects families and friends, neighbors, employers and many others. That is one reason why the Council adopted a target to reduce and ultimately eliminate roadway fatalities and severe injuries. Santa Monica joined in this relatively new movement of Vision Zero cities with adoption of the Pedestrian Action Plan that defines a ten-year target. Walking is a part of the Santa Monica culture, along with being part of a compassionate community that wants to be informed and responsible, and to enjoy roadways that provide attractive and comfortable environments for everyone. This report shares some baseline data and shares best practices for Vision Zero from other cities. Vision Zero was adopted in the Pedestrian Action Plan, but Vision Zero is a movement to protect everyone on the road regardless of what mode they are taking today.  The numbers of pedestrian-involved collisions n ationwide has grown to 15%, up from 11% in 2006. In California, pedestrians continue to make up 25% of all roadway deaths, even though numbers fell slightly in 2016. While the City of Los Angeles does not have citywide data for pedestrian-involved collisions this year, the Los Angeles Times recently published findings that collisions are up 43% from 2015 to 2016 in the City of Los Angeles, with similar trend data for 2 017 thus far. The recent spate of both fatal and injury incidents involving cars and pedestrians appears to be part of a larger pattern of vehicle/pedestrian collisions observed nationwide.  Data Analysis Traffic incident reports are taken by the Police Department for any crash with reported injury (including complaint of pain). The California Highway Patrol consolidates reports from all statewide agencies into a publicly-available database called the Statewide Integrated Traffic Reporting System (SWITRS). Historic collision data from these reports can begin to tell a story about the patterns and possible causes of collisions. A long view of many years can reveal patterns that may not appear when the sample sizes are smaller and over shorter timeframes. Three levels of data were reviewed for this staff report to begin to understand trends, and as a baseline for future detailed investigation as the Vision Zero program develops. ·  Police Department records of all reported collision and citations from January 1, 2013 to April 26, 2017 ·  SWITRS records of all reported collisions from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2016 ·  Pedestrian Action Plan analysis of SWITRS and Police Department reported collisions 2001-2011  Crash Frequency Overall, the City of Santa Monica has seen a slight decrease in crash frequency since 2013, the first year that California law changed its reporting system and removed a mandate that required agencies to take reports at the scene of all incidents.  Since the law was passed, agencies like SMPD are only required to take a report if there was an injury involved (including complaint of pain). For consistency in reporting, 2013 was chosen as the date to begin the data analysis.  Just over 1,500 traffic incidents were reported in Santa Monica in 2013. It dropped to approximately 1,400 in 2014 and has remained stable through 2015 and 2016.   The SWITRS database records severity of injury for all parties. From 2006 to 2016, SWITRS data show 285 total fatal and severe injuries in Santa Monica, or an average of 26 per year. Year over year, the fewest fatalities and severe injuries were reported in 2010 with 20, and the highest was 37 in 2011. At least one fatality occurs each year, with a peak reported of six fatalities in three of the study years.   V ehicles are the only parties in 82% of traffic incidents. Incidents involving people walking and biking are 8% and 10% respectively. Of the severe injuries reported in SWITRS, people walking and driving each represent approximately 40%, with people bicycling making up most of the remaining 20% of severe injuries. Of reported fatalities, people walking are 62%, while people in vehicles are 28% and bicyclists are 8%. People driving motorcycles are 1% of severe injuries, and 3% of fatalities.  People walking and biking make up 60% of severe injuries and 70% of fatalities. This means they are many times more likely to killed or severely injured if involved in a collision, which is why they are sometimes referred to as having higher vulnerability or exposure on the roadway. Time and Day The time of day is an important factor in the incidence of collisions, because it relates to daylight levels, traffic patterns, traffic volumes and other patterns of behavior. The highest number of all collisions occurred between 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. which is also a period of high activity. Residents take trips in almost equal amounts in the morning (8:00 a.m.) and evening (6:00 p.m.), according to the 2016 Resident Travel Survey, but severe injury crashes are more frequent in the evening. Fatal incidents have a less clear trend, but maintain a consistent level after 7:00 p.m. when other severe injury crashes are falling.   While there were no large differences between days of the week, Monday and Wednesday experience the highest number of traffic fatalities and severe injuries, and Friday has the lowest. No noticeable increase is seen weekends which tend to be busier in the Downtown and Beach areas.  Involved Parties The distribution of all fatal and severe injury crashes roughly follows the population distribution, except for young adults. People ages 15-24 make up approximately 9% of the population, but almost 16% of overall fatalities and severe injuries. However the distribution shifts for walking incidents, in which older age groups are over-represented among those killed or severely injured.  People aged 55-64 make up 12.6% of the population, but 23% of walking incidents, and people aged 75-84 are 4.7% of the population and 11% of people killed or severely  injured walking.   Geographical Analysis, 2013-2017 (YTD) Incidents are happening throughout Santa Monica, but trends mirror the findings of the Pedestrian Action Plan.  As the following incident maps illustrate, major intersections and thoroughfares that have the highest volume of traffic also have the highest rates of collisions.  The sheer number of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles traveling on Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Ocean Avenue, and other main streets creates additional exposure. When two main streets intersect, such as the case at Ocean Park Boulevard and Lincoln Boulevard, and in higher activity areas like downtown, the maps show the expected “hot spots.“      As it pertains to traffic education and enforcement, the Santa Monica Police Department ha s maintained a balanced position on allocating resources to these identified areas, focusing in areas with higher concentrations of collisions.  Primary Collision Factors Crash incident reports provide twenty-two options for categorizing the primary cause of the collision, Primary Collision Factors (PCF), selected by the officer taking the report. Options range from unsafe speed to right of way violations and falling asleep. The Santa Monica Police Department has been evaluating data in order to determine appropriate areas in which to dedicate resources. The purpose of such analytics is to ensure the Police Department is distributing efforts in the best possible manner.  Overall, the Police Department citation issuance is on par with the appropriate primary collision factors in the impacted areas throughout the City of Santa Monica.  As can be seen from year to year, the primary collision factors have rotated from Unsafe Speed/Inattentiveness to Unsafe Turning Movements.  Those two primary collision factors account for a majority of all citations issued from year to year by the Police Department.  Right of Way violations such as drivers/bicyclists failing to yield for pedestrians will continue to be an area of focus but the data set presents itself as a tertiary collision factor.  Below is a snapshot of all traffic collisions and citations issued citywide from year to year:  In the 2006-2016 SWITRS data, the top primary causes reported for all collisions resulting in fatal and severe injuries were: ·  Violation of Pedestrian right of way (16%) ·  Unsafe Speed (12%) ·  Pedestrian Violation (12%) ·  Violation of Automobile right of way (12%) ·  Driving Under the Influence (10%)  High vehicle speeds are especially concerning as they limit driver reaction time which limits the ability to avoid unexpected conditions or behaviors which do happen. Speed also increases the severity of injury when crashes do occur, especially for people outside of vehicles. In those cases, the chances of fatality from a crash at 30 miles per hour is 45% but at 20 miles per hour it drops to 5%. SWITRS records also indicate fault for each collision. For collisions involving a pedestrian, pedestrians were assigned fault in 22% of incidents and bicyclists were assigned fault in 42% of collisions involving a bicyclist.     The Pedestrian Action Plan included a comprehensive analysis of ten years of crash data from 2001-2010. Consistent with findings from the Pedestrian Action Plan, recent crashes are occurring on the busiest streets, which have the most people as well as the highest speeds, and seniors continue to be disproportionately involved in the collisions . Santa Monica averaged 100 reported pedestrian-involved collisions a year during the evaluation period. Over the ten years of data, most pedestrians w ere walking legally in the right-of-way when they were hit by a vehicle. Other findings from this data analysis include: ·  Seniors and young children are more susceptible to fatal and severe injury collisions both because of the higher likelihood they will be walking rather than driving, and because they are physically vulnerable. ·  Two-thirds of the pedestrians involved in collision were in a crosswalk. Typically, when a pedestrian is at fault in a collision it is the result of crossing outside a crosswal k. ·  50% of motorists who hit a pedestrian are proceeding straight, followed by making a left turn (22%) or a right turn (20%). The percent of people driving straight immediately before hitting a pedestrian increases to 64% at unsignalized intersections. ·  50% of reported crashes occur at signalized intersections. ·  80% of crashes occur on weekdays, and 35% occur between 3-7pm regardless of day. Vision Zero Vision Zero is rooted in the belief that protection of life, health and safety is a civic priori ty shared by all roadway users. Santa Monica recently joined an international Vision Zero community by prioritizing its implementation as the primary goal in the Pedestrian Action Plan adopted in 2016, seeking to eliminate preventable deaths and severe injuries that result from traffic collisions within the next ten years. Key elements of Vision Zero initiatives include: ·  Project design: define and construct projects to improve the safety for people using the street. ·  Operations: implement operational changes to reduce vehicle speeds that threaten pedestrian and bike safety. ·  Programs: support programs that educate peo ple walking, biking and driving. ·  Behavior and Enforcement: encourage safe behaviors for all road users and enforce distracted driving violations, speeding, etc.  ·  Walkability: promote walkable environments for people and activities. Santa Monica share s these Vision Zero target elements with dozens of other cities, including Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Chicago, Portland and smaller cities like San Mateo and Santa Barbara. Many of these large and small cities have written and adopted a comprehensive Vision Zero strategy.  Traffic safety is a value and priority of all Santa Monicans. Multiple City departments throughout the year strive to make the roads safe, encourage people to be alert, and educate the public about the rules of the road. Independently many departments work to achieve roadway safety by implementing departmental work plans. For instance, Public Works implements extensive annual street and sidewalk maintenance, repair and repaving, and maintains street lights. Planning and Community Development’s Mobility Division works to realize the programmatic and infrastructure goals of the Bike Action Plan and Pedestrian Action Plan, which are discussed in detail later in this report. PCD also maintains traffic signals, pedestrian signals, and roadway signs.   The Santa Monica Police Department’s Traffic Division has engaged in a variety of traffic education and enforcement operations.  Efforts range from driving under the influence (DUI) checkpoints and saturation patrols, traffic enforcement operations, motorcycle safety operations, distracted driving, bicycle/pedestrian safety operations, public service announcements, social media, community meetings and interdepartmental collaboration. Officers conduct traffic safety presentations at WISE, local schools, and community events to provide traffic safety tips. The City also broadcasts via traditional and social media outlets a variety of public safety announcements on pedestrian safety, distracted driving, and other related topics. Traffic safety awareness messages are routinely posted on the Police Department’s and City of Santa Monica’s Facebook and Twitter pages. See Attachment B for details on Police Department enforcement, education and outreach and links to recent safety videos.  Coordination of the existing efforts done by many City departments and divisions into a unifying framework with Vision Zero as a performance target would leverage these investments toward greater community health and wellbeing.    Achieving Vision Zero The Vision Zero Network is an inter-agency collaboration that shares best practices and information in this new field. Cities post their completed vision zero action plans, as well as practices for expanding the reach of safety efforts. Since the Vision Zero target was just recently adopted in the City of Santa Monica, we can learn from other agencies and begin to implement Vision Zero modeled on the best practices from other lead cities. Recommend actions to achieve Vision Zero include: ·  Build and sustain leadership . In New York and Los Angeles, elected Mayors released vision zero calls to action: Mayor Bill DiBlasio , Mayor Eric Garcetti . This includes consensus and commitment among local leadership. Sustain leadership with long-term goals and a strong sense of urgency to implement forward-facing communications as well as long-term investments and changes in practice. Some Vision Zero efforts may not yield results immediately so consistency is crucial. ·  Create a Task Force for interagency collaboration . New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles have all created task forces with roles for transportation, public safety, public health, public works, elected and appointed leaders, community partners, and outreach specialists. A Vision Zero coordinator is appointed to run the task force as a catalytic hub of coordination to insert Vision Zero into on-going departmental work, and to establish accountability for performance. Los Angeles incentivized interdepartmental collaboration through the budgeting process. ·  Develop and adopt a Vision Zero Action Plan. The plan should address specific, measureable and realistic actions. The plan will need to address street design practices, enforcement, education, evaluation, and equity. Some examples of action plans that can serve as starting points include: Los Angeles , San Francisco , Seattle . ·  Change design practices and invest in roadway redesign for greater protection. Los Angeles defined a “high-injury street network” of roadways prioritized for design changes and speed management to reduce the severity of injuries when crashes occur. Elected officials and other leaders need to courage ously lead efforts for street design and operations that prioritize safety and manage speeds , even when resistance arises due to non-safety concerns such as parking and large vehicle access. Los Angeles is currently pursuing investing all of the Measure M Local Return funds into Vision Zero projects. ·  Create an interagency communication and education campaign for Vision Zero. Most programs develop an outreach and education strategy at the front end using tools from behavior change theory. New York evaluated primary crash factors and created targeted marketing materials and communications to reverse those behaviors using high impact imagery and messages. Messages humanize the loss of life. Communications keep the issue at top of mind. In Seattle the safety resources combine print, and media ads for unified strategy. ·  Collect, Analyze and Use Data to inform action, and share it. Use a data-driven process for initial strategies as well as evaluation and adjustment. Boston and New York post online GIS maps with collision information, and Los Angeles has interactive maps of severe and fatal injuries collision data, including victim information. Austin is crowdsourcing public perceptions of safety. Most coordinators prepare annual or biennial report cards. The City Council’s commitment to Vision Zero is an important starting point for action, including communicating the need for responsible action among everyone on the road.  As a compassionate community, it is imperative that we all look out for one another at all times. While it is impossible to predict what the remainder of the year will bring, taking responsibility on the road by being attentive and careful is the first and most important step. 	Santa Monica staff, residents and stakeholders have been actively pursuing the Council’s strategic goal of Establishing a New Model for Mobility . The goal is supported and enriched by connections with the Sustainable City Plan, Wellbeing Project and Land Use and Circulation Element. Efforts like GoSaMo have encouraged Santa Monica residents and visitors to try a variety of mobility options. Strategic planning through the Pedestrian Action Plan and Bike Action Plan organize a multi-faceted approach that has resulted in many more people walking and biking in our community.  The Bike Action Plan marked its 5-year anniversary this year with substantial progress in striping of the 5-year bike network, and opening of multi-year work efforts like the Esplanade, the California Incline and Breeze Bike Share. The Pedestrian Action Plan completed its first year with COAST Open Streets and Downtown Pedestrian “scramble” all-way crossings as primary accomplishments.  The 2016 Resident Travel Survey showed that residents were walking and biking for 22.6% of daily trips before Expo Light Rail opened. With Expo Light Rail operating, pedestrian demand citywide has noticeably increased with new destinations, pathways and people walking. This increase from new mobility options and encouragement underscores the need to actively re-engineer our street environment and to inform the public to achieve our Vision Zero goal to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries. The result is a complete mobility network that rebalances decades of auto-centric planning to create public spaces that are more diverse, as well as community -oriented and environmentally friendly.  So far in 2017, Santa Monica has seen an unusual spike in fatal and severe pedestrian-involved collisions. Similar disturbing trends are being reported in Los Angeles and in other cities nationwide. S taff from the Mobility Division and the Santa Monica Police Department (SMPD) undertook a review of trend data related to traffic collisions within City boundaries. Between 2006 and 2016, Santa Monica traffic collisions resulted in an average of 26 fatalities and severe injuries among all roadway users. Vehicle collisions are 82% of all reported incidents, but 70% of all reported fatalities are pedestrians and bicyclists.  Incidents are happening throughout Santa Monica, primarily on major thoroughfares with the highest volume of traffic. Major collision factors are unsafe speeds and right-of-way violations, and SMPD citations are written in a similar proportion to violations . In addition to enforcement, City staff actively engages the community to encourage safe behaviors on the road in meetings, videos and print media . Current policy makers inherited a landscape designed for the automobile during fifty years of national, state and local myopia in seeing streets strictly as conveyances for auto and truck circulation.  Santa Monica has been a pioneer in reviving the principle that “streets are for people” whether they are walking, biking, taking transit or driving their own vehicles.  We are, however, a long way from reversing the legacy of engineering and investment decisions that advantaged auto mobility and relegated pedestrian, bike, and transit mobility to second-class status at best.  Looking ahead, t he landscape of mobility is changing rapidly due to policy and technology evolution . I n this time of transition, Santa Monica can continue to be a leader in new ways of designing, mana ging and regulating our streets to serve all people , guided by co mmunity values of sustainability, diversity, and wellbeing . It is important to recognize , however, the scale of this challenge – and the opportunity it represents for Santa Monica to be a model for enhancing transportation choices, innovation and safety.   Pedestrian Action Plan Adopted in February 2016, the Pedestrian Action Plan just went through its first year of implementation. It was a fortuitous year, synchronized with opening of the Expo Light Rail and GoSaMo outreach, that encouraged and celebrated walking in Santa Monica.  Whether you are one-year or one-hundred years old, walking is an activity done by everyone-- on two feet, with a walker, or in a wheelchair. From walking the dog, strolling on the beach or running to the corner store, walking provides the foundation of both the transportation system and much of the fabric of life in Santa Monica. Despite the fact that walking is a part of all trips, whether as the primary mode of travel or a way to get from a bus or car to the final destination, walking is often taken for granted. A complete, high-quality pedestrian network is therefore necessary to make all aspects of the transportation system work well.  Hundreds of people participated in creation of the Pedestrian Action Plan and their input shaped its four essential themes: ·  Walking is part of the Santa Monica lifestyle and enhances wellbeing. ·  More pedestrians of all ages and abilities, and fewer collisions. ·  Improve walking and reduce obstacles like freeway and boulevard crossings. ·  Walking is a shared priority, and safety is shared responsibility. The Pedestrian Action Plan also included an analysis of anticipated pedestrian demand (based on land use, transit facilities and socio-economics), pedestrian supply (such as sidewalk widths and marked crosswalks), and a decade of pedestrian-involved collision reports to develop a robust and fact-based plan of action.  The Pedestrian Action Plan’s action strategy is organized into 9 Practices, 13 Programs, and 84 Projects. Practices include how City departments approach their daily activities relative to pedestrians. Programs engage people to reduce the social and perceptual barriers to walking, and encourage more people to walk safely. Projects improve the infrastructure for walking, and the P roject list is broken down into 5-, 10- and 15-year segments. To measure performance, the Plan recommends a biennial report card beginning in 2018 that measures progress toward Vision Zero, mode share of walk trips (as total trips, commute trips, and school trips), and progress on capital project construction. Progress on the first year of Pedestrian Action Plan implementation is described below in the three major action categories (see Attachment A for more details).  Practices Changes to City practice s address daily work habits, policies and priorities to increase the efficiency of implementing Pedestrian Action Plan recommendations. Although they can seem obscure or small, changes to practice can be powerful because they leverage existing efforts to achieve new goals. However, c hanges to practice need to be catalyzed and guided, which requires staff effort and focus. Once institutionalized, the benefits can be on-going and require much less investment. Three practice changes were started in the first year: ·  Reduced Vehicle Sp eed in School Zones: Council adopted 15 mile per hour (mph) speed limits on neighborhood streets adjacent to the community’s public K-12 schools, taking advantage of changes in state law. Sign installation is anticipated this summer . ·  Use of a Project Ch arter: City Departments have agreed to use a project charter memo to document project goals and milestones, with the intent that key pedestrian designs, amenities or community preferences are not lost in engineering. ·  Lead Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs) pro vide a head start for pedestrians crossing at signalized intersections. These few additional seconds increase pedestrian visibility to motorists. LPIs were created on Olympic Drive at Ocean Avenue and Main Street, and for crossings of Lincoln Boulevard at Marine Street, Ashland Avenue and Pearl Street . More locations are being identified . Efforts to coordinate the many positive activities and efforts already underway, and to institutionalize slight changes in practices that aid pedestrians, can generate significant advancements in Plan implementation. Additional benefit will come from practices that reduc e vehicle speeds , and facilitate roadway design, signal and street operations that put people first . Other cities have developed Street Design and Operations Guides with performance goals that catalyze more complete street solutions. Prioritizing pedestrians in work plans and in the project and program development process, supported by a pedestrian coordinator is recommended by the Pedestrian Action Plan.  Programs Programs provide encouragement, outreach, education and a human touch to support walking in Santa Monica. COAST Open Streets, held in June, 2016, was the biggest and most encompassing pedestrian program in the Pedestrian Action Plan’s first year. Two miles of streets were closed to cars, while approximately 50,000 enthusiastic participants experienced Santa Monica on wheels and on foot. Local businesses, organizations, community groups, and City departments produced interactive, engaging activity hubs along the route that included the Main Street Farmers market. Main Street was often filled with people strolling and stopping to take in the performances, socialize, shop or just enjoy the street space. Metro partially funded this first event, and a second grant will be used to partially fund a 2018 Open Streets event. Planning is underway for Santa Monica’s second COAST Open Streets Festival to be held on October 1, 2017.   The Safe Routes to School (SRTS) program connected with students and parents through Bike-It! Walk-It! Bus-It! days, which this school year included a walking school bus organized by parents at McKinley Elementary. Walking to school continues to be a popular option, although much work has yet to be done to increase the percentage of kids walking to school and create less stressful conditions during drop-off. SRTS education is happening through CREST afterschool programs and during events like the Fall Festival, COAST and National Night Out.          Other programs recommended in the Pedestrian Action Plan underway this year included: ·  Walking Tours - GoSaMo piloted walking tours such as a history tour with Tom Explores Los Angeles and a food tour with Hedley & Bennett. Santa M onica Conservancy continued its weekly walking tours of Downtown history. ·  Safety Campaigns - The Police Department created a Move Safe campaign of public service announcements , videos , and print media. The Move Safe messaging was included on the back of the thousands of City-issued parking hang tags. ·  Street Activation through Art and Special Amenities - Lincoln Boulevard traffic signal boxes were treated with creative designs. Creative crosswalks were piloted at two Downtown intersections. Artwork is being planned for the Colorado Esplanade that will be tied to an experience along the Promenade that encourages people to walk all the way up to Wilshire Boulevard. The Pedestrian Action Plan recommends a number of additional programs, including group walking events, a series of mapped walking routes, walking challenges, and communications that encourage walking as an alternative to other modes. It identifies opportunities to focus on segments of the community with unique needs such as initiating a walking group for seniors or in certain neighborhoods, recurring walking events such as “Walk with a Doc,” or monthly themed walks in association with the Wellbeing Office, Safe Routes to School or Buy Local.  The Pedestrian Action Plan recommends creating a Safe Routes for Seniors program to provide active opportunities for seniors to foster healthy aging and longer years of independent living. Staff convened a group of community stakeholders and senior service providers to brainstorm possible program components. Using these ideas, staff prepared grant requests to the State Active Transportation Program (ATP) and Regional Sustainability Planning Grants programs. The applications scored well, but did not receive grant funding.   Projects The 5-year project list in the Pedestrian Action Plan consists of seventeen projects that were anticipated or budgeted in the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) from Metro Call for Projects or State Active Transportation Program grants. A two-year Pedestrian Action Plan allocation was made in the FY16-18 CIP that will be used for 2017 COAST Open Streets Event. Work underway from the 5-year project list includes: ·  Pedestrian-oriented lighting on Michigan Avenue between 9th and 17th Streets and along portions of Stewart Street at Kansas Avenue. Pedestrian-scale lighting supports people to walk comfortably at night, especially in areas with dense tree cover. Michigan lighting will be complete this summer, and Stewart Street in early 2018. ·  Three parklets on Main Street are opening in June as places for people to take a break, enjoy local activity and create a social space that increases pedestrian comfort. ·  Safe Routes to School enhancements for Edison Language Academy will provide curb extensions, new crosswalks and/or raised crosswalks, consistent with the Michigan Avenue Neighborhood Greenway plan. ·  Lincoln Boulevard bus lane and pedestrian improvements with a first phase that will include new crossings, and curb extensions. ·  Pedestrian wayfinding signs around each Expo Light Rail station that give direction, walking time, and biking time to major public locations. The California Incline and Pedestrian Bridge, and the Colorado Esplanade were completed in 2016 with major new pedestrian facilities. The Esplanade’s signature sidewalks are used by thousands of people daily as they crisscross the Downtown, Civic Center, Expo Station and Pier. While these multi-year projects were hitting construction completion, pedestrian “scramble” phases were added to 12 intersections in Downtown as a jump-start project of the Mobility Strategic Goal. The scrambles increase pedestrian visibility and awareness in the City’s highest pedestrian-volume intersections, and eliminate potential conflicts between pedestrians and left-turning vehicles. Additionally, intersections at Arizona Avenue/Second Street and Ocean Avenue/Broadway were painted with creative unique designs that celebrated unique site features. These creative crosswalks were a pilot place-making program that is currently being evaluated.   The GoSaMo outreach efforts in the last year helped to leverage investments in physical projects by encouraging more people to use them. The campaign was launched with the light rail but encourages walking along with other modes. GoSaMo created a unified identity for mobility that assisted with outreach and making connections with people. GoSaMo created tools to engage with people about walking, and helped facilitate conversations about a mode of travel that is arguably the most popular of all among Santa Monicans.   Planning and design is starting on a few projects right now, including sidewalks on Olympic Boulevard from 26th to Stewart Street, lighting and upgrades to Fourth Street south of Colorado Avenue, and pedestrian lighting and curb extensions on 17th Street from Pico to Wilshire. Progress to encourage walking could be catalyzed through other projects identified in adopted plans including Safe Routes to School access improvements at active schools like McKinley Elementary, Neighborhood Greenway Projects in the Bike Action Plan like Washington Avenue, and improvements to Nebraska Avenue in the Bergamot Area Plan area. Additional investment in GoSaMo would facilitate targeting unique user groups and needs.  Bike Action Plan 2016 marked the fifth anniversary of the Bike Action Plan. Since its adoption in 2011, cycling has grown in Santa Monica, evidenced by the significant numbers of people on the street and the growing range of riders. On any day in Santa Monica, one can see an incredible diversity of riders including women, men with children on board, young riders, and experienced senior riders. From 2011 to 2015, bike counts citywide grew 50% overall in the biennial transportation counts. Although the counts dropped in 2015, counts coming this fall 2017 are anticipated to increase due to Breeze Bike Share. The 2016 Resident Travel survey showed that 6 % percent of all trips made by residents are on a bicycle.  The Bike Action Plan outlines a pragmatic, balanced, and ambitious strategy to achieve a 14-35% bicycle mode share through programs, bikeways and supporting facilities in 5-year and 20-year work plans. Progress on Bike Plan implementation is described below in these two categories, and includes an update on Breeze Bike Share, excerpts from the Bike Action Plan performance measures and a look ahead to the next five years. See Attachment A for additional details.  Programs Breeze Bike Share got people going and changed the cycling culture in Santa Monica. Bike Share Stations located throughout Santa Monica make Breeze virtually a door-to-door service. The point-to-point model makes cycling as convenient and flexible as walking or taking a car service, and is actually more convenient than driving because you can park right in front of your destination. In addition to convenience, the striking green color of the bikes serves as a strong visual reminder of Santa Monica’s commitment to biking. Breeze bikes are always available as an option, even as a spontaneous choice since you can sign up and ride immediately. The bikes have been well-used by residents who make up 16% of subscribers and ride 46% of trips.  The bikes have on-board GPS that collects valuable data about each trip. In 2016, the Breeze system had: ·  309,000 bike trips ·  664,500 miles ridden ·  43,000 active subscribers The system exceeded expectations for its first full year. Ridership for 2017 is following similar seasonal trends with an overall higher daily use. Tracking frequently-ridden routes an d frequently-used stations is informing system adjustments. Routing can also be used to plan and prioritize new bikeways, or improvements to existing bikeways, such as additional buffers and intersection accommodations.  In 2016, Breeze Bike Share gave away 476 helmets at eight events to promote safety and to increase membership. In November, Breeze celebrated its one-year anniversary with over 100 community members on a community ride and party. This year Breeze continues its education and engagement efforts by: hosting quarterly community rides where participants can try Breeze for the first time, giving away over 500 helmets to new users, promoting the Employee Benefits Program that gives discounts to employers who bulk purchase Breeze memberships for their employees, and partnering with Community Corps of Santa Monica (CCSM) and Santa Monica Spoke to teach smart cycling classes at CCSM properties and help CCSM residents subscribe to Breeze for greatly reduced rates. Breeze riders can already use their accounts to ride in systems in West Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Long Beach (and UCLA this fall) as a pay-as-you-go rider. Staff is working on a Memorandum of Understanding with these other agencies to add additional features for customers that further integrate the systems.  Many Santa Monica residents continue to feel unsure on a bicycle. Making connections with people about biking in Santa Monica is the cornerstone of the awareness and encouragement program. This takes many forms - events, classes, friendly challenges, and partnerships. The City’s Bike Coordinator works to implement an annual program of events that meet residents where they are going, and forge partnerships that extend the reach of City’s efforts including: ·  May 2016 Bike Month - Council honored engaged residents with a proclamation of Bike Month. A “GEAR UP for Bike Month” festival was hosted at McKinley Elementary including bike rodeo, bike swap, family bike testing and bike accessories. Over 400 people attended and 50 bike swaps were made to get kids and parents the right fitting bike. Over 200 people stopped by the City Hall Bike to Work Day Pit Stop, and hundreds more participated. Santa Monica Spoke promoted events throughout the month. All of these programs are being offered again in 2017. ·  Safe Routes to School: Bicycling was a feature of most Safe Routes programs this year. Over 900 Samohi sophomores completed a one-hour cycling safety class enabled by grant funds and administration support. Six bike safety skills trainings also taught 150 youth through the CREST afterschool program. ·  Rides: Five Kidical Mass Rides welcomed over 300 participants for fun family ride together while also learning safe riding techniques, bike fit and helmet fit (Valentine’s Day, Earth Day, July 4 th , Kidical Mass-IVE, Halloween). A m onthly ride with the Mayor was kicked off in January. ·  Bike Rodeos: SM Spoke partners with the City on four rodeos where kids learned riding and road skills. This fun activity is becoming a beloved component of Santa Monica community events. ·  Bike Center: 2016 was also the 5-year anniversary of Santa Monica’s Bike Center Downtown that provides rental, repair and commuter services. The Center rents roughly 33,000 bikes a year including 10% family bike rentals of hard-to-find bikes. Sustainable Streets, an associated effort of the Bike Center, also hosted dozens of Adult Learn to Ride, Ready to Ride, Confident City Cycling and Bike Maintenance classes . ·  Bike Registration: Free bike registration was set up by SMPD in partnership with www.bikeindex.org <http://www.bikeindex.org>. Victims of bicycle theft can search for their property, police can identify stolen bicycles, and buyers can check that goods are not stolen. Staff has prioritized being present at the many events hosted in Santa Monica as one tool to grow bicycling into part of the culture of life in Santa Monica. Providing interactive engagement and refreshed materials at events has helped to connect with residents and employees to encourage people to bike for more trips around town. Booths, rides, displays and incentives were provided at events like the Buy Local Health & Fitness Festival, Sustainable Quality Awards, Fall Festival, Bike Expo, and many more.  In 2016, GoSaMo provided a boost of bike outreach by creating new tools to engage with people about biking. The new postcards, buttons, and activations of GoSaMo helped facilitate conversations about bicycling with people of all experience and bike-confidence levels. The bike and walking buttons were the most popular throughout GoSaMo outreach.  Bikeways In 2016, the community celebrated the opening and operation of some long-awaited protected bikeways. These facilities were constructed along with major capital projects, and complement the City’s signature off-street path, the Marvin Braude Beach Bike Path. Although shorter in length, these protected facilities help to make cycling more comfortable and feasible for many people: ·  The Expo Bicycle/Pedestrian path which extends 1.4 miles in Santa Monica from 17 th Street eastward to Centinela Avenue and continues into the City of Los Angeles. ·  The Colorado Esplanade protected bikeway from the Expo station to the Pier. It is a short .25 miles but a significant connector and heavily ridden. ·  The California Incline protected bikeway from Ocean Avenue to the beach. This .25 mile stretch enables a rider to go from the city to the sand without ever leaving the saddle.  At the time of Bike Action Plan adoption, Santa Monica had only six miles of off-street bike path, 31 miles of striped bike lanes, and 38 miles of bike routes (no striping). There were countless gaps in the network and many locations where one could travel for blocks without encountering a bikeway. The cycling landscape of Santa Monica is very different today. Over 110 miles of bike lanes and paths exist today, having been created through a new practice to coordinate restriping with the City’s annual roadway repaving work. Several bike lanes have been upgraded with painted buffers and/or green paint. Bike routes have been upgraded to include sharrow markings, which serve as visual reminders to drivers and cyclists alike that bikes belong in the street. In places where insufficient space existed for bike lanes in both directions, climbing lanes were installed to provide a lane in one direction and a sharrow in the other (with the sharrow downhill if a grade exists). The City is implementing its first Neighborhood Greenway in phases along Michigan Avenue and adjoining streets, providing a low-stress facility for users of all ages and abilities connecting the Pico Neighborhood to various destinations. The resulting network is dense and connects to every neighborhood, and was created with minimal loss of parking spaces or vehicle travel lanes. Whereas 2016 welcomed several large infrastructure projects, 2017 will have fewer ribbon cuttings as staff works to bring additional projects to fruition in 2018 and beyond: ·  Design work is underway on extension of the separated Beach Bike Path from its current terminus at Arizona Avenue to the north City limit. This will reduce conflicts along the Marvin Braude Coastal Bike Trail by separating cyclists and pedestrians. ·  Outreach is beginning on pedestrian lighting, curb extensions and protected bikeways on 17th Street from Wilshire to Pico Boulevard. ·  Design will begin for subsequent phases of the Michigan Avenue Neighborhood Greenway (MANGo) through multiple grants, including reuniting the discontinuous segments of Michigan Avenue where it is bisected by the freeway and the 20 th Street Bridge.  Which is not to say that 2017 will be without its share of projects. In spring, the grant-funded Bicycle Technology Demonstration project will bring one hundred additional bicycle racks, detection for bicycles at three signalized intersections, and bike boxes at the intersections of 11 th Street/Broadway and Ocean Avenue/California Avenue. The racks will fulfill requests received from the community over the past two years. In fall a Metro grant will enable 1,250 additional racks, and high-visibility green markings to many bikeways between Montana Avenue and Ocean Park Boulevard.  Five Year Performance Indicators The Bike Action Plan identifies a set of eleven performance indicators in three categories (Mode Share, Safety, and Infrastructure and Services). Since adoption of the Bike Action Plan, improvement has been realized in virtually all performance indicator categories and excerpts are summarized below.  A few have plateaued or gone down slightly over the past year. ·  The mode share for employees of large employers in Santa Monica who commute by bicycle is 4%, while 59% drive alone. These figures represent both residents and non-residents who work at local employers with 30 or more employees. The bicycle mode share de creased one percentage point since 2015. ·  The 2015 citywide count of peak hour cyclists is 12,061, down 15% from 2013. This decrease belies the larger overall trend in cycling since 2007, which has increased over 50%. Counts will be conducted again in 201 7 and an increase in ridership is anticipated with the presence of Breeze Bike Share. ·  There were 116 cyclist-involved crashes in 2016 which is a 7.4% increase from 2015 but an overall 13.4% decrease since 2014. ·  Five new lane miles were added to the bi cycle network in 2016 which is an increase of almost 5%. ·  Public bicycle parking was increased by 162 spaces, or 5.4%. Increases included bike lockers and racks installed by the City or Metro at the three Expo stations. Metro bike lockers have a waiting list of 25-30 people for each station. ·  Since bike parking requirements were increased in the Zoning Ordinance, dozens of private properties have been reviewed that provide i mproved on-site bike parking for employees, customers and residents . ·  In 2016, there were 196 events with bicycle valet, with 13,512 bicycles valeted. This represents roughly the same number of events as 2015. Breeze set up drop zones at large events since they are not accepted at valets. ·  Santa Monica is home to eleven Bicycle Fr iendly Businesses and one Bicycle Friendly University (Santa Monica College). Main Street added new bicycle retailers bringing the district’s total to seven bike shops. ·  The first bike feedback display and counter was installed in front of City Hall. Over 60,000 bikes have been counted since January 1, 2017, and the data is publicly available on a website <http://eco-public.com/public2/?id=100034648> .   Looking Beyond the Bike Plan’s First 5 Years While staff is optimistic that traffic counts to be conducted later this year will show an increase in cycling trips over 2015, some stakeholders have been critical that cycling has not grown at a faster rate. Many communities are looking for ways to increase the opportunities for biking to achieve sustainability, health and wellbeing goals. Cities are joined by non-profit groups like People or Bikes, The Alliance for Walking and Biking, and t he League of American Bicyclists, and locally by Santa Monica Spoke, a chapter of the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition. The Bike Action Plan targets a 14-35% cycling mode share, which is currently at 4% for employees according to annual employer surveys, and 6% for resident trips according to the 2016 Resident Travel Survey. Some inspiration for Santa Monica’s next phase of Bike Action Plan implementation can be found in the work of these groups and agencies: ·  P eople  For  Bikes offers a Big Jump Project that support s  cities to realize a 2-3x increase in cycling mode share. People for Bikes levera ge the  c ity’s capital investments with training, outreach and communications, data collection support, and research. Staff applied in 2016  but was  not selected. ·  Outreach , Outreach , and more Outreach - Continue regular events, including Kidical Mass ride s, the Gear Up event, and Bike It! Walk It! Bus It! days at all public schools in Santa Monica which appeal to kids and families. Expand the type and style of outreach to bring more people to the events. Create new tools to keep events fresh and interesting. ·  Celebrate successes - use communications to build on and reinforce the capital investments in new facilities. Create communications material about new facilities and do outreach to celebrate openings and invite people to try them. ·  A data-driven appro ach - create a framework for the collection and evaluation of bicycling data using crash data, trips made on Breeze bike share, traffic counts, smart phone or app data, and potentially user surveys. ·  Strat egic outreach and activities - d evelop additiona l targeted outreach tools and messages for other user groups that could see an increase in riding. I dentify and focus on target audiences. The City could use GoSaMo as a base to develop targeted outreach.  Santa Monica received the prestigious “Silver” Bicycle Friendly Community ranking form the League of American Bicyclists in 2013. The League renewed the City’s Silver level ranking and made recommendations for improvement including institutionalizing the Vision Zero goal, adopting a Complete Streets policy and to establish a Bicycle & Pedestrian Advisory Committee.  Santa Monica residents consistently provide feedback that they would bicycle more if the roadways felt more comfortable. In the 2016 Resident Travel Survey 43% of residents said that better infrastructure for walking and biking would encourage them to use those modes. Closing gaps in the network, especially near the I-10 bridges, completing the network of neighborhood greenways identified in the Bike Action Plan, and creating more physical protections for people on bikes are all possible approaches. Physically protected facilities provide barriers such as a curb, planter or parked car that provide a greater sense of comfort to people of varied ages and abilities. Barriers require reallocation of roadway space, such as changes to parking and vehicle travel lanes in instances where no other solution exists. The Bike Plan did not identify priority corridors for protected bikeways. Staff could strategically evaluate protected bikeway options based on demand, connectivity and feasibility. This would be an amendment to the Bike Action Plan, to lay the groundwork for bringing these types of facilities to more neighborhoods.  Future Policy and Technology Considerations The landscape of mobility is changing rapidly due to policy and technology changes. These changes necessitate new ways designing, managing and regulating our roadways. Santa Monica has pledged to be Carbon Neutral by 2050 or sooner, and kicked off a planning process to reach th is target through the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan. Santa Monica has also committed to Wellbeing as a framework for Citywide performance management that prioritizes human health, safety, resiliency and opportunity. Globally, transportation is being driven forward by changes in technology, communications, sensing and automobile design. Staff will provide a more detailed update on these issues later this year as part of the Mobility Strategic Goal , but provides an initial discussion related to safety below.  Climate Action and Adaptation Plan (CAAP) Initial data gathering for the CAAP modeled citywide emissions and found that a startling 65 percent of emissions are generated by the transportation sector. Achieving Carbon Neutrality will require creative thinking about how we travel. Changes in f uel alone cannot achieve the significant reductions needed. Today’s infrastructure does not provide the attractive and comfortable conditions to entice enough new users. A virtuous cycle of safety has been shown in many studies – the more people walking and biking on the roadways, the lower the rate of collisions with motor vehicles. This pattern was already seen in Santa Monica since 2011, when the number of people biking increased overall but the rate of collision s with motor vehicles decreased.  T he resident travel survey shows that Santa Monicans are walking and biking in above-average numbers. But we are also driving short distances frequently with 62 % of vehicle trips under three miles. These cold engine starts and short driving distances add to our emissions profile, and finding alternatives for some of these local trips will contribute substantially to achieving the goals of Carbon Neutrality . Making streets even more appealing to people outside a vehicle through protected and connected bike and pedestrian facilities, providing electrified first-last mile solutions that support transit use, and increasing the attractiveness of existing modes will be key.  Autonomous Vehicles Of the approximately 35,000 annual fatal collisions nationwide, approximately 95% are due to driver error (National Highway Traffic Safety Association, 2016). Common nationwide issues are driver behaviors such as alcohol impairment, distracted driving and excessive speed. As a result, autonomous vehicles (AV) are often cited as a panacea for roadway safety. Also known as driverless vehicles, the vision is for vehicles capable of sensing their environment and navigating roads without human input. There is great enthusiasm in the marketplace for AV potential, leading many car and technology companies to partner on development and testing ventures.  Enthusiasm for the potential of automation could eclipse the complex realities of human behavior on the road, unique roadway conditions typical for a community like Santa Monica, and long-term coexistence of both computer and human-controlled vehicles. AVs also have the potential to increase travel demand, which increases the exposure to crashes for all people on the road. Automation could also undermine the transit networks that move people most efficiently and safely. How cities deploy and manage these changes will make the difference between whether they result in improved mobility and safety or increased congestion and exposure. Santa Monica should actively engage with this new policy environment to influence directions that advance community values of sustainability, diversity and wellbeing.  Cities are starting to grapple with AV policy, but few have any adopted policies, practices or guidance. Santa Monica needs to begin local discussion and policy-making with regard to AVs in coordination with the Mobility Strategic Goal and to establish necessary data, communications and transportation infrastructure. Much of this conversation is happening at the state and federal levels, and Santa Monica should engage actively and create a working group to guide policies and advocacy that promote: ·  Safety . Encourage automation that support s Vision Zero and advocate for maximum operating speeds of 20-25mph on city streets. Ensure vehicles function in conditions with many people walking and biking, and unusual roadway configurations.   ·  Sustainabili ty and Wellbeing, not increased vehicle miles. Encourage electrification of AVs, shared fleets over private ownership, and shared rides. ·  Modernized freight and delivery . Advocate for non-peak hour deliveries, automated truck route enforcement, and use o f clean truck technology. ·  Updated funding base for transportation . Fuel and vehicle fees will see radical changes in revenue streams , look for sustainable transportation funding options under potential new automation scenarios. ·  Local planning for the f uture of cities . Technology has the power to help communities achieve both their transportation and land use visions, taking public space back from space previously used by vehicles. Cities manage and control local roads so e nsure local cities are at the table.  Santa Monica can look for opportunities to advocate for shared, electrified autonomous vehicles that support the sustainability and quality of life values of Santa Monica and our vision for the future. Actions may include organizing a working group, organizing and supporting a regional or sub-regional working group, or staff and elected officials actively participating in national, state or regional organizations.  	\N	9
46	Introduction for First Reading an Ordinance on Water Neutrality	Public Works, Office of Sustainability & Environment	In response to Council’s November 24, 2015 directive, staff has drafted a water neutrality ordinance.  This ordinance would help Santa Monica achieve the goal of becoming water self-sufficient by 2020 through limiting the city’s water demand.  The ordinance would not allow a new development to exceed the water use of the existing development on that property.  If that requirement could not be met onsite , the excess water demand would have to be offset by reducing the water demand (through fixture replacement) at another site within the city.  The water neutrality ordinance would require funding totaling $2,647,728 million over five years. Of that total, an initial appropriation of $2, 272,123 would be required to prepare it for implementation.  Of this total $2,0 89,74 9 would be completely recouped, through newly-established fees, as new developments are approved and completed. The remaining $5 57 , 979  would fund a technical design assistance program to help designers incorporate new and more water-efficient tec hnologies to achieve compliance, software updates to administer the program, and initial costs to setup the program. The $5 57 , 979 would not be recoverable through fees. 	On November 24, 2015, Council directed staff to develop a water neutrality ordinance with the intent to keep the city’s total water demand from increasing as a result of new development (Attachment A). Council directed staff to prepare an ordinance that would require 1) new developments to stay within the same water use as the existing property through the installation of water-efficient fixtures and systems; 2) provide an In-lieu Fee option if compliance could not be met; and 3) provide a credit for affordable housing.  Council also directed that implementation of an offsite retrofit program funded by In-lieu Fees be provided by City staff and/or a vendor. 	Over the last year and a half staff has convened regular meetings and solicited a significant amount of public input to assist with the development of this ordinance.   Stakeholders have included the Water Neutrality Stakeholder Committee (Stakeholder Committee) which is comprised of representatives of water agencies, non-governmental organizations, sustainability consultants, architects, developers, manufacturers, engineers, plumbers, Los Angeles County; the City’s Water Advisory Committee; and staff from the Public Works Department, Planning and Community Development Department, and the City Attorney’s Office.  Based on the input received from these groups, staff is recommending the proposed water neutrality ordinance (Attachment B) that would:  1)  Require new developments to be as water-efficient as possible through the design and installation of the most water-saving plumbing fixtures and/or non-potable water systems including graywater, rainwater harvesting, blackwater systems, and municipally supplied recycled/non-potable water (such as water from the Santa Monica Urban Runoff Recycling Facility (SMURRF)).  2)  If compliance cannot be met after all practical water-saving devices and systems are included in the design, the developer would be required to cover the costs to offset the water at an offsite location through the City’s turn-key retrofit program and/or perform retrofits at self-selected sites at their own cost and risk.  3)  The City’s initial turn-key retrofit program would include an Administration Fee and In-lieu Fee to cover the costs to implement and retrofit existing properties with water-saving toilets, urinals, showerheads, faucet aerators and/or other permanent water saving measures.  4)  Affordable housing would receive a credit. Instead of a 1:1 ratio for water offsets, 100% affordable housing new development projects would be required to meet a 0.5:1 offset ratio.  5)  Replace the Water Demand Mitigation Ordinance, effective March 1, 2018. Paths to Compliance Applicability - New Development Effective March 1, 2018, this ordinance would apply to new developments which include new buildings with plumbing fixtures; existing buildings with plumbing fixtures where 50% or more of the exterior walls or principal structural supports are demolished; and new or enlarged swimming pools, spas, water features, and ponds.  This would not apply to a new garage that has no plumbing fixtures, a kitchen or bath remodel or an addition that does not require the removal of 50% or more of the exterior walls/structural supports.  Recent data shows between 60 to 100 projects per year (with an average of 72) would be required to comply with the ordinance, including City projects. Seventy-six percent of these projects were single-family new developments. Since 2014, more than 150 new swimming pools were permitted.  Building Design When a new development applicant applies for the initial building permit. Staff would notify the applicant of the water neutrality ordinance, as the entire design could be impacted by this requirement.  The City would provide the applicant with the existing property’s five-year average water use. This would be the baseline to compare projected new water demand. Where no water data is available, the baseline would be the five-year average of properties in the same customer class with the same meter size (example: single-family home with a one-inch meter). Five-years was chosen to reflect water use demands where varying occupancy, tenancy, and climate affects could be accounted for and averaged. Using only the most recent year or two could show a major shift in usage such as vacancy or severe water shortage restrictions, which would significantly impact the offset requirement.  The baseline for water neutrality is completely separate from baselines used to establish water use allowances as part of the Water Shortage Response Plan.  Staff is also recommending a new program to provide technical design assistance to help applicants achieve water neutrality. This was a specific request from the Stakeholder Committee to help designers select new technologies that they may not be aware of or have never specified in a project which would help them achieve compliance with the ordinance. The estimated $ 425,000 for five-years would pay for a consultant to review preliminary concepts and/or plans, provide recommendations for water-saving technologies, and direct the designer to additional resources and/or funding opportunities. Some technologies save both water and energy such as efficient showerheads, cooling towers, and recirculating hot water systems. The City’s technical design assistance program would work in coordination with the existing Southern California Edison (SCE) and the Gas Company’s Savings by Design Program, which, currently, tier 1 and tier 2 projects are required to utilize to achieve energy savings and receive financial incentives. The technologies recommended by both programs would be consistent for those products that save both water and energy. The SCE and Gas Company Savings by Design Program is funded by the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC).  City staff tried to expand upon the SCE and Gas Company to include water saving fixtures but they cannot add devices that only save water at this time due to CPUC regulations. Funding for the City’s new technical design assistance program is included in the FY 2017-19 Proposed Operating Budget.  Projected New Water Demand In order to standardize the projected water demand from a new development, a water demand calculator would be made available online to assist in the design of new developments and to show comparisons of projected water demand based on different plumbing fixtures, non-potable water systems, and landscaping choices. A water demand spreadsheet would be created by this calculator and would be used as part of the building plan set submission.  The City and County of San Francisco has authorized the City to use its existing water demand calculator. Staff, in partnership with the Stakeholder Committee and the vendor selected to implement the offset program, would adapt this calculator to meet local conditions and current plumbing codes in Santa Monica.  At the time of implementation, the calculator would provide sufficient data for the majority of new single-family and mixed-used development projects. The calculator would include the water use for toilets, urinals, showers, faucets, climate control systems, landscaping, pools, spas, water features, and ponds. Water benchmarking data, water usage data for specific types of water using devices for residents and businesses, is almost non-existent.  Currently, the calculator is limited to water usage for only a few fixtures that have data such as toilets, urinals, and faucets. The calculator would evolve as more data becomes available for how much water various fixtures use in specific types of buildings, e.g. hair salon hair washing stations or restaurant dishwashers for a 30 - seat capacity full service restaurant. In the future if a new full-service restaurant with 30 seats used the calculator, it would provide the projected demand for all the water using fixtures onsite such as for food-prep, thawing food, dishwashing, and cleaning in addition to toilets, urinals, and faucets.  Plan Check Once developers decide on a final design, they would submit the new water demand spreadsheets to the Office of Sustainability and the Environment for review and approval. If a new development is designed to use no more water than the previous property’s five-year average, the project’s new water demand plan would be approved and no additional requirements would be applied.  In-lieu Offsets If a new development is designed with all practical water-savings measures and additional water demand is still projected, the project would not be considered in compliance with the water neutrality regulations and would be required to offset the additional projected water use.  Offsets would be achieved by retrofitting devices and plumbing fixtures like toilets, urinals, showerheads, and faucet aerators in an existing property located in Santa Monica . The number and type of retrofits would vary depending on the amount of water needed to offset each project. Developers would have the option of utilizing the City’s turn-key retrofit program and/or performing their own retrofits. For developer retrofits, the City would require approval of the devices and their corresponding water savings estimates in addition to permits and inspections for those installations. For the City’s program, toilets, showerheads, and faucet aerators would be installed initially and the City’s vendor would be responsible for inviting owners of existing properties to participate in the retrofit program. The vendor would also pre-screen buildings to ensure they meet the criteria for retrofitting. The Stakeholder Committee recommended a priority installation list where low-income multi-family apartments would be asked to participate first followed by high-water use multi-family apartment then low-income single-family homes, etc. Multi-family properties are easy to retrofit and have more residents than individual single-family homes, thus generating higher water-savings.  Most single-family homes are likely to achieve compliance by installing very water-efficient fixtures and landscaping on-site to meet existing building code requirements. These new developments would be more water-efficient than previous homes.  However, installing a pool where one did not exist before or adding several new bathrooms as part of the new development project could require offsets somewhere else in the city.  The proposed water neutrality ordinance is drafted to allow for flexibility in the design of water-efficient buildings in order to meet compliance. These are new technologies that may not be approved by the Los Angeles Department of Public Health and/or the State Water Resources Control Board at this time for installation in certain buildings such as graywater for toilet flushing in an apartment building. These agencies are developing a permitting process for a variety of new water-saving technologies and installation locations.  Administrative and In- l ieu Fees When an applicant is required to offset additional water use an Administrative Fee would be assessed. Additionally, if the applicant chooses to participate in the City’s turn-key retrofit program an In-lieu Fee would be charged. The Administrative Fee covers the costs for administering the ordinance including coordination with the developer, maintenance of the projected water demand calculator, retrofit site selection, audits, inspections, data entry, and reporting. The In-lieu Fee covers the costs for the retrofit of water-saving fixtures elsewhere in the city. These two fees would cover the City’s costs to implement this ordinance and would not be refundable . The fees are based on the costs charged by a vendor to implement the water neutrality ordinance.  The amount of the In-lieu Fee would be based upon the cost to achieve the necessary water savings generated by replacing existing toilets, showerheads, and faucet aerators. This includes the cost of the replacement fixtures and the cost to install them.  In order to calculate the water savings, certain assumptions would be made such as occupancy rate (numbers provided by the City’s Planning Division), old and new fixture flow rates, duration of the flow or use, and per capita daily usage. The Stakeholder Committee agreed upon the formulas and assumptions included in the draft ordinance.  A request for proposals was issued on December 16, 2016 for the administration and implementation of the in-lieu offset retrofit program.  Two bids were received , however , both bids were incomplete and not reviewed. The request for proposals was re-issued on January 24, 2017. Two bids were received and evaluated by staff.  The costs provided by the top ranking vendor was used as the basis for the Administrative Fee and In-lieu Fee (see Attachment C for In-lieu Fee). Retrofits performed by the City’s vendor are subject to prevailing wage requirements.  On July 11, 2017, staff will bring to Council a request to authorize negotiation s with the top ranking vendor. Staff will also request for Council to set the plan check fee, inspection fee, the Administrative Fee, and the In-lieu Fee related to this ordinance as part of the annual fee schedule update on June 27, 2017.  The Administrative Fee would be a flat rate of $2,000 per project to be paid at the time of the building permit issuance. This Administrative Fee covers the cost of the vendor to help City staff implement this ordinance and it includes coordination with staff, the developer, maintaining the calculator, selecting and pre-screening the retrofit sites, verifying developer retrofits, reporting, and City prevailing wage reporting. The vendor could also provide plan check and inspection services if needed. Fifty percent of the In-lieu Fee would be paid at the time of the building permit issuance and the balance is to be paid at the time of the temporary certificate of occupancy or certificate of occupancy.  Splitting the In-lieu Fee payment allows for adjustments in the design of the building that may need to be made during construction and that could impact the projected water demand. Changes to the building’s plan would require additional plan check and submission of a new water demand spreadsheet. Offset requirements could change along with In-lieu Fees. Fees already collected would not be reimbursed.  Retrofits Once the fees are collected, the City’s vendor would arrange retrofits with pre-screened properties. The retrofits would target low income, high water use customers, and buildings where sewer capacity is higher than average. Once the eligible list of properties is retrofitted, staff would look for new opportunities to save water on private and public properties. The retrofits would include the removal of the old fixtures, replacement with new water-saving fixtures such as showerheads, toilets, faucet aerators, and the recycling of old fixtures when available. Recycling facilities do not accept used toilets and/or metals from used showerheads and faucets. Broken porcelain toilets can easily puncture tires or cause injury so many recycling facilities, including Allan and Company in Santa Monica, no longer accept them.  The retrofit potential for toilets, showerheads, faucet aerators within existing buildings in Santa Monica is estimated at about 60,000 total fixture replacements. This is based on fixture replacement rates from previous retrofit programs between 1989 and 2003.  Hardship A hardship provision is included in the draft ordinance that waives the ordinance requirements if it can be demonstrated that the off-set requirement would deprive the owner of all economically beneficial use of that site or be prohibited by state or federal law.  Estimated Costs to Developers The examples below provide estimates of how the projected new water demand and off-sets would be calculated but do not show the actual demand and/or off-sets. The fees were calculated using the top ranking vendor’s cost proposal. Please note that the examples below are based on codes and standards used in the current online calculator developed by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission for buildings in San Francisco. Santa Monica will use this online calculator as a template and update the data based on the Committee’s decisions using local conditions and the current plumbing code requirements.  Single-family Home: Offset Requirement = 50,000 gallons per year Retrofits Required for Offset = 21 fixtures (6 toilets, 5 showerheads, 10 faucet aerators) to be installed which would save 51,028 gallons per year Admin Fee: $2,000 In-lieu Fee: $3,243 Total: $5,243 ($0.10/gal saved)  Mixed Use Development with 60 units: Offset Requirement = 722,553 gallons per year Retrofits Required for Offset = 301 fixtures (76 toilets, 75 showerheads, 150 faucet aerators) saving 722,612 gallons per year to be installed Admin Fee: $2,000 In-lieu Fee: $43,983 Total: $45,983 ($0.06/gal. saved)  Effect on Other Ordinances Water Shortage Response Plan When a water supply shortage is declared by City Council as a Stage 1, 2, 3, or 4, water use allowances go into effect. This requires mandatory conservation and water customers to reduce use by a set percentage from a prior year’s water usage. Currently, the City is in a Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage and water use allowances are in effect. Water customers that exceed their water use allowance are subject to fines and civil penalties.  On May 23, 2017, staff will bring to Council an update to the Water Shortage Response Plan that would require the new development’s new water demand to become the water use allowance during a declared water supply shortage. Using the approved water neutrality demand calculation as the water use allowance provides the most accurate water budget and would likely not result in a citation, adjustment or appeal. However, penalties could still be assessed for using more than the updated water use allowance.  Water Demand Mitigation Ordinance If adopted, the water neutrality ordinance would replace the existing water de mand mitigation ordinance (WDM), effective March 1, 2018, when the new water neutrality ordinance will be ready for full implementation. The existing water demand mitigation ordinance would automatically terminate on February 28, 2018.   The proposed water neutrality ordinance is designed to keep water levels at current levels and any offsets would be at a one-to-one ratio, except 100% affordable housing new development projects. Offset retrofits would be installed at private and/or public properties and would no longer be restricted to only City-owned properties.  Water Neutrality Costs The water neutrality ordinance would require funding totaling $2,647,728 million over five years. Of that total, an initial appropriation of $2, 272,123 would be required to prepar e it for implementation. Of the total $2,0 89,749 would be completely recouped, through newly-established fees, as new developments are approved and completed. The remaining $55 7,979 would fund a) professional services for software updates b) initial vendor costs for implementation and c) a  Water Savings by Design technical design assistance program to help designers incorporate new and more water-efficient tec hnologies to achieve compliance . The $595,000 would not be recoverable through fees.  The professional service cost for development and implementation of the water neutrality ordinance over five years is $2,425,000. Non-reimbursable up-front costs include a) $100,000 in professional services to upgrade the existing database software system to track new developments and retrofits and b) $70,000 for a new vendor to initiate the implementation of the ordinance, update the water demand calculator, and setup the retrofit program and c) the Water Savings by Design technical design assistance program would cost $425,000 over a five-year period and is non-reimbursable.  The $1,830,000 for offset retrofits would be reimbursed through the collection of Administration and In-lieu Fees.  $250,000 was included in the Water Rates 5-year forecast for these up-front costs  Staff will return to Council on July 11, 2017 with a recommendation for the modification to the existing contract with ConserveTrack, LLC for the database software system upgrades and a new contract with DNV GL Energy Services USA, Inc. for the administration of the water neutrality ordinance.  OSE is also requesting one existing Water Resources position be deleted and replaced with one Sustainability Analyst position. The Sustainability Analyst would spend 20% of his/her time implementing water neutrality. The other 80% of his/her time would be spent implementing water conservation programs related to water shortage response and water self-sufficiency. The total staff cost for five-years is $122,728. Water neutrality plan check and inspection fees collected would total $ 159,749 cover the staff costs to implement this ordinance.  Water neutrality implementation would include managing the contract with the vendor, educating the public about the ordinance, and providing plan check and inspections for water neutrality projects. The work associated with water shortage response and water self-sufficiency include implementing the water use allowance citations, providing water school for water use allowance citations, providing water use consultations and other water conservation related tasks as requested. Should the water supply shortage be rescinded and water use allowances end, this Sustainability Analyst could take on the administrative tasks assigned to the vendor implementing the water neutrality ordinance. The position is requested as part of the FY 2017-19 Operating Budget.  Timeline Upon Council approval of this ordinance by resolution, award of the proposed contracts, and contract execution (estimated to take between four to six months), staff would continue to meet with the Stakeholder Committee to finalize the implementation plan and implement the projected water demand calculator. Staff would also provide outreach and education to homeowners and professionals about the ordinance and develop the technical design assistance program , if funded. Full implementation of the ordinance w ould occur on March 1, 2018. At that time those applicants pulling a first application would be subject to the ordinance. Those applicants that have already pulled a first application, are in the entitlement process, submitted plans, or received a building permit before March 1, 2018 would not be subject to compliance with this ordinance. For those applicants/permit holders, retroactive compliance with the ordinance would require significant design review, changes to the project and signifcant additional costs.  Below is the projected timeline for implementation of the proposed water neutrality ordinance:  Outreach Five Stakeholder Committee Meetings were held on November 15, 2016; December 12, 2016; January 24, 2017; March 8, 2017; and April 4, 2017; where proposed requirements of the ordinance and its implementation were discussed and a consensus on recommendations w as achieved. Staff presented the draft ordinance to the Chamber of Commerce Governmental Affairs Committee on March 6, 2017. A public meeting was held on April 6, 2017 and 10 community members attended. Staff also presented the draft ordinance to the North of Montana Association (NOMA) neighborhood association on April 6, 2017 and at the Mid-Cities neighborhood association on April 18, 2017. The public was notified by emails sent to all the neighborhood groups and business districts, Facebook postings, a press release, and a calendar event listed on the City’s website. Information about the ordinance and how to comply will be posted on the City’s website prior to implementation.  Water Advisory Committee Staff presented the draft ordinance to the City’s Water Advisory Committee on February 6, 2017.  Following discussion , the committee recommended support of the ordinance.  Task Force on the Environment Staff presented the draft ordinance to the City’s Task Force on the Environment on March 20, 2017.  Following discussion , the Task Force unanimously approved a motion in support of the ordinance.  If adopted staff would provide additional outreach and education to architects, landscape architects, neighborhood groups, business districts, and the community at large. On November 24, 2015, staff presented City Council with three options to develop and implement a water neutrality ordinance. Council chose one option and directed staff to return with an ordinance. The proposed water neutrality ordinance attached is based on Council’s directions. An alternative to this proposed ordinance is to keep the existing Water Demand Mitigation Fee in place and not approve the proposed water neutrality ordinance. Future year costs of $2, 272,123 and new revenue s are included in the FY 2017-19 Proposed Budget and are contingent on Council budget approval. 	\N	9
59	Public Hearing and Issuance of Lease Revenue Bonds, Series 2017	Finance Department	Staff recommends that the City Council and Public Financing Authority (PFA) approve documents required for the issuance of Lease Revenue Bonds, Series 2017 to finance the City Services Building pr oject.  The determination to issue lease revenue bonds is made based on the City’s intent to distribute the cost of building an essential facility over its useful life, the City’s access to low-cost financing, and the City’s low level of existing debt. Due to the high environmental standards associated with the design of the City Services Building, s taff recommends that the Series 2017 Bonds carry the designation of “Green Bonds”.  Bonds will be secured by a lease agreement between the City and the PFA that will include the right to use the City’s Main Library and City Hall during City Services Building construction, following which lease payments will be for the City Services Building use and occupancy only .  Bond proceeds will also cover bond issuance costs. The proposed Series 2017 bonds will be for a maximum principal amount of $ 76,760,000 , with a final maturity date of July 1, 2047 and a maximum true interest cost of 5.00 %. 	On March 27, 2012 (Attachment I ), Council authorized staff to select a design consultant to provide initial design feasibility analysis and cost estimation services for the City Services Building.  A City Services Building was part of the Civic Center Specific Plan and fulfills a long-standing need to eliminate expensive offsite leased space and coalesce city services in one location.  On April 8, 2014 (Attachment J ), Council authorized staff to execute an agreement with design-build contractor Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company (including design firm Frederick Fisher and Partners Architects), for initial design, cost estimation services, and feasibility analysis for the City Services Building.  On January 27, 2015 (Attachment K ), Council reviewed and provided comments on the feasibility analysis, concept design and financial options for the City Services Building and authorized the design services phase for an approximately 50,000 square foot building, with three stories above grade and a basement level.  Additionally, Council directed the project team to pursue the Living Building Challenge – internationally , the most rigorous and ambitious building environmental performance standard .  On April 28, 2015 (Attachment L ), Council authorized the City Manager to execute a design-build contract with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company for a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for design services for the City Services Building of $7,064,501 and to authorize direct owners costs associated with the design phase in the amount of $540,000.  On May 24, 2016 (Attachment M ), Council reviewed and commented on the schematic design and cost estimates for the City Services Building, and directed staff to proceed with design development that endeavors to achieve Living Building Challenge certification for the project.  On November 1, 2016 (Attachment N ), Council approved an increase in the GMP design services with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company associated with additional required services , bringing the new total amount not to exceed $8,756,981.  On August 8, 2017, staff is recommend ing that Council authorize the City Manager to negotiate and execute a GMP second amendment to contract 10051 (CCS) with Hathaway Dinwiddie for construction services in the amount of $61,843,526 (includes a 2.4% contingency) for a total amount not to exceed $ 70,600,507 . 	Staff is recommending that the City issue lease re venue bonds in the amount of $76.76 million to fund the City Services Building project. When determin ing w hether to issue bonds to cover this capital cost, the City has considered a number of factors.  First, t he City’s adopted financial policies assert the prudence of using debt financing to distribute the cost of a facility over its useful life.  Also, o wing to its sound financial health and resulting high credit ratings, the City is able to benefit from low-cost financing .  T his allows for greater flexibility in all ocating existing resources .  Finally, the City is able to take advantage of favorable conditions in the municipal bond market due to its very low level of debt. With regard to the last factor, the City’s indebtedness is limited by Article VI of the Cit y Charter, which state s that the bonded indebtedness of the City may not exceed the sum of 10% of the total assessed valuation of property within the City.  With this bond issuance, staff es timates that this indicator would reach 0.44%.  A breakdown of the total costs of the project is shown in the table below.   Feasibility Study 4/8/2014 $           258,000* Design-Build: Design Services 4/28/2015 $        7,064,501* Design-Build Amendment 1: Additional Design Services 11/1/2016 $           381,729* Design-Build Amendment 2: Construction GMP (CSB) 8/8/2017 $      61,243,526 Direct Owner Costs* Various $        7,052,244 * Percent For Art TBD $           760,000 Total Cost * Funding previously allocated .  O nly  $772,000 of Direct Owner Costs were previously allocated . Hathaway Dinwiddie cont r act includes $1,910,750 for City Hall improvements not included in the total CSB project cost.   A portion of the bond proceeds will be used to reimburse the General Fund for previous feasibility study, design services appropriations and direct owner costs.  The bonds w ould be secured by a lease agreement between the City as lessee and the Santa Monica Public Financing Authority (PFA) as lessor.   The lease agreement is based on use of City Hall and the City’s Main Library during City Services Building construction.  Once the City Services Building is completed and occupied by the City, expected in 2020, the Main Library and City Hall will be removed from security for the lease and payments will be solely for City Services Building use and occupancy.  This arrangement means that the City will not need to include interest due on the bonds during construction in the bond amount (capitalized interest).  Due to the high environmental standards associated with the design of the City Services Building, s taff recommends that the Series 2017 Bonds carry the designation of “Green Bonds”.  This designation is a signal to bond investors who may have a preference for investing in projects that promote climate change mitigation and meet other environmental objectives.  Staff recommends a negotiated bond sale whereby the bond underwriter is predetermined and the Bond interest rates are set through a process of negotiation.  A negotiated sale, as compared to an open competitive bid, is the best way to ensure the bond underwriter is in compliance with the City’s recent banking services Resolution (Resolution No. 11025 City Council Series-adopted February 28, 2017).  Upon Council approval of the Series 2017 Bond issuance, the City’s financial advisor will assist staff in determining the fair market value for the Bond interest rates and issuance of the bonds.  To select a  bond underwriter, the City’s financial advisor distributed a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to 18  commercial and investment banking institutions active in the California tax-exempt bond market.  The RFQ required respondents to certify the firm was in compliance with the City’s recent banking services resolution.  Fourteen firms responded to the RFQ.  The financial advisor rated the firms based on a combination of factors including their recommended approach to the bond sale, relevant experience with similar financings, methodology to execute the bond sale, compensation, and compliance with City social responsibility guidelines per Resolution 11025.  The recommendations were then presented to Finance Department staff who made the final selection of Morgan Stanley as lead manager, and Fidelity Capital Markets and Stifel , Nicolaus & Co. as co-manager s.  In preparation for issuance of the bonds, credit ratings were requested from three credit rating agen cies that currently maintain credit ratings on the City and Authority bonds.  The credit rating agencies – Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and Standard & Poors – each assigned their highest possible lease revenue bond ratings to the bonds (AA+, Aa1, and AA+, respectively) and affirmed the City’s AAA/Aaa/AAA general obligation bond credit ratings. The attached resolutions and documents permit the City and PFA to proceed with all steps necessary to issue the Series 2017 Bonds.  The resolutions approve the attached documents and authorize their execution and delivery by the specified agency’s officials and employees.  The resolutions also approve the preparation, execution, and delivery of a Final Official Statement ; the execution and delivery of any additional documents and  certificates ; and the performance of such acts or related actions as may be necessary or desirable to effect the offering, sale, and issuance of the Series 2017 Bonds.  The Resolutions authorize the PFA to issue Series 2017 Bonds with a maximum principal amount of $7 6 , 760 ,000 ,  with a final maturity date of July 1, 2047 and a maximum true interest cost of 5.00 %.  This August 8, 2017 meeting serves as a public hearing relating to the public benefits of financing the City Service s Building improvements through the PFA.  Staff published this public hearing notice in the Santa Monica Daily Press on August 1 , 2017; at least five days prior to the hearing date as the Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (JPA) law requires. Approving the recommended actions will result in the PFA issu ing  up to $7 6 , 760 ,000 in tax-exempt Lease Revenue Bonds.  The estimated annual debt service, to be paid from the City’s base rental payments pursuant to the Lease Agreement, would be approximately $ 3.1 million (interest only) through fiscal year 2020 and rise to approximately $4.4 million between fiscal years 2021 and 2047.  The Capital Improvement Program ( CIP ) appropriation for project construction is included in the FY 2017-18 budget in account C014083.589000.  Other accounts required to record transactions related to the bond issuance and debt service payments are listed in the table below.  Any necessary budget changes will be made as part of the Year-End Budget Review in October 2017 after the bonds are issued and exact amounts are known.   	\N	12
47	Santa Monica Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency Memorandum of Understanding	Public Works, Water Resources	The local water agencies of City of Santa Monica, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, City of Beverly Hills, City of Culver City, and Los Angeles County overly the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 empowers local agencies to adopt groundwater management plans to ensure resilience for local water supplies. In order to comply with the requirements of the Act, these agencies have developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to establish the Santa Monica Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency to effectively manage groundwater in the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin.  In order to meet the agency formation deadline of June 30, 2017, the fully executed MOU and resolutions acknowledging each local agency’s participation in the agency must be submitted to the State Department of Water Resources.  There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of the recommended action.  Background  On September 16, 2014, Governor Brown signed a package of three bills to advance sustainable groundwater management in California. The legislation, known as the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), provides a framework for improved management of groundwater by local authorities. The bills are SB 1168 (Pavley), SB 1319 (Pavley), and AB 1739 (Dickinson).  The legislation provides local agencies with the tools to manage groundwater basins in a sustainable manner over a long-term horizon and allows for limited state intervention when necessary to protect groundwater resources. SGMA establishes a definition of sustainable groundwater management, requires that local agencies develop groundwater management plans and implement strategies to sustainably manage groundwater resources, prioritizes basins with the greatest need (ranked as high and medium priority), and sets a timeline for implementation as follows:  ·  June 30, 2017: Local Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSA) must be formed. ·  January 31, 2020: Groundwater Sustainability Plans (GSP) must be completed for basins in a critical condition of overdraft. ·  January 31, 2022: GSPs must be completed in al l other high- and medium-priority basins not currently in overdraft, including the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin. ·  Twenty years after adoption of the GSP (2040 and 2042): All high- and medium-priority groundwater basins must achieve sustainability.  The Santa Monica Groundwater Basin is categorized as a medium-priority basin. The State prioritized groundwater basins utiliz ing  eight specific criteria: overlying population, projected growth of overlying population, public supply wells, total number of wells, irrigated acreage overlying the basin, reliance on groundwater as the primary source of water, impacts on the groundwater, and other information deemed relevant by DWR. 	\N	SGMA provides GSAs with a broad array of new authorities. For example, it provides local GSAs with the authority to conduct investigations, determine the sustainable yield of a groundwater basin, measure and limit extractions, impose fees for groundwater management, and enforce the terms of a Groundwater Sustainability Plan (GSP).  Nothing in SGMA is to be construed as authorizing a local agency to make a binding determination of the water rights of any person or entity. In addition, SGMA states that nothing in a GSP supersedes the land use authority of cities and counties.  SGMA includes provisions to promote engagement by interested parties in the formation of a GSA and development and implementation of a GSP. GSAs must identify key parties and maintain records that spell out how their interests will be included in GSA operations and GSP development. SGMA requires the GSA to provide this information to the California Department of Water Resources. The GSA is the primary agency responsible for achieving sustainability within the mandated timeframe.  The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act empowers local agencies to adopt groundwater management plans that are tailored to the resources and needs of their communities. Good groundwater management will provide a buffer against drought and climate change, and contribute to reliable water supplies r egardless of weather patterns. For Santa Monica, development of a groundwater management plan for the entire Santa Monica Groundwater Basin provides an opportunity to enhance its stated objective to achieve water self-sufficiency through a collaborative effort with other local agencies overlying the basin.  Groundwater Sustainability Agency Formation SGMA promotes coordinated management of an entire groundwater basin.  A map of the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin is provided in Attachment A.  Any local agency or combination of local agencies overlying a groundwater basin may form a groundwater sustainability agency (GSA) for the basin. Attachment B provides a map of the local agencies overlying the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin.  A combination of local agencies may form a GSA by joint powers agreement or memorandum of agreement or other legal agreement. Local agencies have until June 30, 2017 to form a GSA. The GSA applicant must notify the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) of the formation or establishment of a GSA within 30 days of final formation, and 90 days later the applicant shall be the exclusive GSA as long as no other local agency submits a notification of its intent to undertake groundwater management in all or a portion of the same area.  City of Santa Monica GSA Involvement The 50-square mile Santa Monica Groundwater Basin underlies Santa Monica and portions of Los Angeles , Beverly Hills and Culver City . In preparation for submitting GSA formation documents to the state Department of Water Resources by the June 30 deadline, City of Santa Monica staff, in concert with other agencies overlying the Santa Monica Basin, including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, City of Beverly Hills, Culver City, and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works (collectively, "the Parties") has developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the creation of the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin GSA.  The MOU is provided as  A ttachment C to this report.   The Parties have indicated a preference to have the City of Santa Monica serve as the point of contact on behalf of the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin GSA as well as the lead in undertaking other obligations of the GSA.  Santa Monica is the appropriate lead agency for the GSA as the predominant groundwater pumper in the basin over the last 20-30 years. As the coordinating agency, Santa Monica would provide the single point of contact with the State, prepare and file annual reports as required by SGMA, administer service contracts, and coordinate the administrative functions of the GSA.  Existing staff will perform these duties.  The negotiating representatives intend to develop a unified GSP for the entire Santa Monica Groundwater Basin. The assignment of SGMA implementation duties (including data and cost sharing obligations) may be negotiated as part of the GSP. To date the powers and duties of the Parties, individually and collectively, including cost sharing, have yet to be fully negotiated so final decisions on these may be deferred until the GSP development process in order to expedite formation of the GSA.  Public Information Meeting SGMA statutes require that a GSA consider all interests of all beneficial uses and users of groundwater in the basin.  This includes the interests of a variety of different stakeholders, including beneficial users of water, environmental interests, disadvantaged communities, tribes, and others. The agency must maintain a list of persons interested in receiving notices regarding plan preparation and other activities.  Toward this end, a public information meeting was held on April 12, 2017 at Windward School in Mar Vista to provide potential stakeholders and interested parties an opportunity to become informed about SGMA requirements and status of local GSA formation efforts.  A list of stakeholders notified of the meeting and those in attendance is included in Attachment D .  The application for formation of the GSA must be submitted to the State Department of Water Resources by June 30, 2017.  Included among the submittal requirements are resolutions from the each of the agencies forming the GSA and the fully executed MOU.  The resolution attached herewith as Attachment E authorizes formation of the GSA and Santa Monica’s participation therein, and the MOU is the governance document for the GSA.  The May 9, 2017 Santa Monica City Council meeting serves as the required Public Hearing for Santa Monica’s election to become part of a GSA for the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin.  Notice of this public hearing was published in the Santa Monica Daily Press on April 25, 2017 and May 2, 2017.  Similarly, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, City of Beverly Hills, City of Culver City, and Los Angeles County Department of Public Works have conducted Public Hearings.  Copies of the multiple resolutions and the fully executed MOU will be submitted to the State Department of Water Resources by June 30, 2017. 	\N	9
48	Establishment of Preferential Parking Zone RR and Amendment of Zone U and adopt a Resolution establishing Preferential Parking Regulations.	Mobility (PCD)	Residents of the 2300, 2400, and 2500 block of Fourth Street, and the 500 block of Strand Street have submitted qualifying petitions for preferential parking regulations. The residents assert that non-resident parking is impacting their ability to find parking near their homes. A parking study conducted in August and September of 2015 confirmed that street parking has high usage throughout the day for both the weekend and weekday.  Staff recommends creating Preferential Parking Zone RR, approving the following preferential parking regulations for the following blocks: ·  Fourth Street between Pico Boulevard and Ocean Park Boulevard, and Strand Street, Pacific Street, and Bay Street between Third Street and Fourth Street with the regulation “No parking 10 P.M. to 7 A.M., 2 hour parking 7 A.M. to 10 P.M., daily, except by permit”, and  ·  Strand Street between Fourth Street and Sixth Street with the regulation “2 hour parking 7 A.M. to 6 P.M. daily, except by permit” (reclassifying these two blocks from Zone U to Zone RR) .  Should Council approve the recommended action it is estimated that permit sales for the 2300,2400, and 2500 blocks of Fourth Street would generate approximately $11,000 annually, which would offset, but not fully recover, the cost to the City of issuing permits to residents. New permit revenue would not be expected to be generated for the 500 block of Strand Street, as it has pre-existing preferential regulations that are being changed, so there would be few if any new permits issued. Additionally, new signage would be required at an estimated cost of $1,200 for all four blocks. 	Preferential parking is a tool the City uses to manage non-resident parking use on residential streets, as authorized by  Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 3.08  and the California Vehicle Code. Preferential parking regulations manage the use of on-street parking to make parking more available for residents near their home. Only residents who live on a block with preferential parking restrictions are eligible to purchase a permit. Permits may be used within two block faces of the permit holder’s address.  Residents may petition to initiate a preferential parking zone at any time. Upon receipt of a petition representing two-thirds of the residential units on a block, a parking occupancy study of the neighborhood is conducted and a community meeting is held. In evaluating the petitions, staff typically evaluates the larger neighborhood, rather than an individual block due to the potential for parking displacement when regulations are established or changed. As a result, staff typically recommends that the Council pre-approve preferential parking regulations for more than one block to streamline and expedite the process for adjacent blocks should some displacement occur. SMMC 3.08.030 provides Council with the authority to create preferential parking zones.  Once Council approves preferential parking regulations, they are implemented on the block or blocks that have submitted qualifying petitions. Preferential parking regulations are not implemented on blocks that have been pre-approved by the Council until the time that the residents of those blocks submit qualifying petitions representing two-thirds of the residential units on the block . 	 The residents of Fourth Street between Strand Street and Hollister Avenue, and Fourth Street between Hollister Avenue and Ocean Park Boulevard have submitted complete petitions requesting to install preferential parking regulations. Residents of Strand Street between Fifth Street and Sixth Street currently located in Preferential Parking Zone U submitted a petition to change their current parking regulations from “2 hour parking 7AM-6PM Monday-Friday, except by permit” to “2 hour parking 7AM-6PM daily, except by permit”. The surrounding area includes: ·  to the east Preferential Parking Zone U “2 hour parking 7AM-6PM Monday-Friday, except by permit”,  ·  to the west Zone M “No parking 10PM-2AM, 2 hour parking 9AM-10PM daily, except by permit”, and   ·  also to the west Zone I “No parking 6PM-2AM, 2 hour parking 9AM-6PM daily, except by permit”.  The existing area regulations and petition blocks are shown in Attachment B.  Parking demand in the area is high due to its dense residential nature as well as its proximity to the successful business district on Main Street. A summary of peak parking occupancies is included as Attachment C. The summary is based on a parking survey conducted in August and September 2015 for both weekend and weekday time periods from 7 A.M. to 10 P.M., to capture both summer and Santa Monica High operations. ·  For both August and September for both the weekend and weekday parking occupancies on Fourth Street, Bay Street, and Pacific Street are near or above 85% occupancy between 7 A.M. and 10 P.M.  ·  For both August and September for both the weekend and weekday Strand Street between Third Street and Sixth Street parking occupancies are near or above 85% occupancy except for the block between Fifth and Sixth Streets which has still high but lower parking occupancy during the morning.  The data indicates street parking is in high demand throughout the day and most residents may be required to circle the block to find a parking space near their residence.  Community Input Residents, businesses, property owners, the neighborhood organization, and business districts of the area were notified of the proposed preferential parking zone by mail and invited to a June 23, 2016 community meeting to discuss preferential parking. A listing of the comments received at the meeting and in writing is included as Attachment D. A summary of the major issues stated at the meeting are listed below: ·  residents expressed a preference for regulations limiting overnight parking to residents and limited time parking for those without permits during the day;   ·  residents expressed concern regarding employees working on Main Street parking all day on Fourth Street;   ·  some residents preferred more restrictive all day regulations; and  ·  some residents were opposed to any preferential parking regulations and voiced concerns regarding inconvenience, cost of parking permits, and difficultly for visitors to park.   Recommended Preferential Parking Regulations Based on the parking occupancy study which showed high usage of street parking throughout the day and the community comments stating the difficulty of finding street parking and a desire for preferential parking, staff recommends approving the following preferential parking regulations for the following blocks: ·  Fourth Street between Pico Boulevard and Ocean Park Boulevard, and Strand Street, Pacific Street, and Bay Street between Third Street and Fourth Street with the regulation “No parking 10 P.M. to 7 A.M., 2 hour parking 7 A.M. to 10 P.M., daily, except by permit”, and  ·  Strand Street between Sixth Street and Fourth Street with the regulation “2 hour parking 7 A.M. to 6 P.M. daily, except by permit”. As the intention of preferential parking is to improve access to street parking for block residents and as the parking located on the Fourth Street median is adjacent to and frequently used by residents of Fourth Street staff recommends the proposed preferential parking regulations be applied to the parking located in the Fourth Street center medians. Hotchkiss Park is a community park that borders Strand Street and Fourth Street.  Street parking along the curb immediately adjacent to the park would not be changed to maintain public parking access to the park. The Community and Cultural Services staff communicated they are not concerned about the proposed preferential parking regulations.  Coastal Zone The preferential parking area is located within the Coastal Zone. Staff does not believe that the approval of the preferential parking area would require a Coastal Development Permit, as the City has made significant infrastructure investments to improve beach access. The City provides thousands of public parking spaces at the beach and has made significant investments to improve transit, pedestrian, and bicycle access to the beach. Thus, staff does not believe the establishment of preferential parking Zone RR or modification of Zone U would adversely impact public access to the beach.  However, a Coastal Development Permit will be obtained if required by law. .   . Staff will inform Council if the Coastal Commission believes that a Coastal Development permit is required.  Alternatives The Council could maintain the existing conditions or adopt different hours and types of restrictions than recommended. The Council could also direct staff to pursue a Coastal Development permit prior to implementation of the regulation.  Environmental Analysis The proposed project has been determined to be categorically exempt from the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), pursuant to Article 19, Section 15301 (c) which defines Class 1 exempt projects in the following way: “Class 1 consists of the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agency’s determination.” The exemption includes: “Existing highways and streets, sidewalks, gutters, bicycle and pedestrian trails, and similar facilities.” Preferential parking zones involve only the issuance of permits for the use of an existing public street and include negligible or no expansion of the existing use.  Next Steps If preferential parking regulations are approved and there is no action pursued with the California Coastal Commission, regulations would be implemented on the 2300, 2400, and 2500 block of Fourth Street, and 500 block of Strand Street within eight weeks. This allows time for: residents to apply for permits, staff to process applications, signs to be ordered, manufactured, and installed, and a grace period between the installation of signs and the enforcement of preferential parking regulations. Additional blocks within the zone would have preferential parking implemented approximately eight weeks after receipt of a petition signed by residents representing two-thirds of the residential units of that block. #0 	\N	9
49	Second Modification to Software and Maintenance Agreement with Accela, Inc. for Permit and Land Management Software	Information Systems Department, Software Systems	Accela’s Land Based Management System, Accela Automation, is one of the most widely used systems in the City. Several departments use Accela Automation to manage various types of information, such as land information, inspections, and code enforcement cases. Accela Automation is also used to manage the City’s permitting process. Using Accela Automation, staff can review and approve applications, issue permits, and receive payments. Inspectors use Accela Automation’s Mobile Apps to complete inspections in the field. The public  use s Accela Automation’s Citizen Access portal to get the status of their applications, make payments, and research properties. Continued maintenance support is necessary for Accela Automation to remain current.  At this time, staff recommends extending the maintenance agreement with Accela, Inc. for a n additional period of up to five years in the amount of $230,469 for a total contract amount not to exceed $798,141 . 	On August 11, 2011, the City released a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement a new Land Based Management System. Five responses were received. Accela’s Land Based Management System, Accela Automation, was selected based on price; the quality of the software product; the ability, capacity, and skill of the vendor to provide a Land Based Management System; and the vendor’s client base, which included agencies with comparable system requirements and services.  On November 22, 2011, Council authorized an agreement with Accela, Inc. in the amount of $546,672 to implement and maintain Accela Automation, a Land Based Management System that allows staff to manage permitting, inspections, and code enforcement activities. The agreement with Accela, Inc. included software implementation, one-time licensing, maintenance, and technical support over a five-year period.  On July 8, 2014, Council approved the first modification of the agreement with Accela, Inc. in the amount of $21,000 to cover additional professional services for data migration and system configurations that were necessary to complete the implementation of Accela Automation. This has resulted in a new total contract amount not to exceed $567,672.   On January 31, 2017, the City Manager issued an intent to renew letter to Accela, Inc. to extend the term of the software maintenance and support agreement for a period of one (1) year, subject to Council authorization and budgetary app ropriation.  Software maintenance and support services are  essential to ensure business continuity, receive system updates and product support, and maintain compliance with building regulatory requirements. 	  Currently, City departments use Accela Automation to manage planning applications, plan checks, permits, inspections, code enforcement cases, collections, and land information. Residents and business owners use Accela’s Citizen Access web portal to apply for permits, pay outstanding fees, and research properties. Over the years, significant financial resources and training hours have been invested by the City in this Land Based Management System.  The software licenses previously purchased by the City for the Accela Automation System are perpetual and require no renewal.  Accela Automation System is a proprietary system. Hence, Accela, Inc. is the only vendor can provide system updates and product support, and preserve the health of the system.  By extending the maintenance agreement with Accela, Inc., the City will continue to retain its ability to streamline and provide effective permitting services to the public.  Vendor/Consultant Selection O n August 11, 2011, the City issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the purchase of a web-based land based management system. The RFP was posted on the City's on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the SM Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions.  39 vendors were notified, 5 vendors downloaded the RFQ/RFP.   Five firms responded.  Responses to the RFP were reviewed by a selection panel of staff from Building and Safety, the Fire Department and Information Systems Department.  The following vendors submitted proposals: Accela, Inc., EnerGov Solutions, CRW Systems, Inc., Cartegraph Systems, Inc., and Calvin, Giordano & Associates, Inc.  The proposals were evaluated based on price, product availability and quality, references from similar work, and, the ability of the vendor to meet the project specifications and the technical environment in which the system would operate. Staff then interviewed five shortlisted firms. Based on this criteria and criteria in SMMC 2.24.073, staff recommended Accela, Inc. as the best qualified firm for the purchase and implementation of a land based management system based on the relative cost of the system, ability to provide seamless integration with City existing systems, as well as the company's stability, technical expertise and ability to meet all the requirements of the RFP . 	\N	10
50	Appeal of Landmarks Commission Technical Denial of the Designation of the Former Home Savings Building Located at 2600 Wilshire Boulevard as a City Landmark	Design & Preservation (PCD)	The appellant, the Santa Monica Conservancy, has filed an appeal of the findings of the Landmarks Commission in its February 13, 2017 technical denial of the former Home Savings building as a City Landmark and site as a Landmark Parcel .  The former bank building and site ha ve been analyzed by the City’s historic consultant who has concluded that the building - constructed in 1970 - retains the key character defining features typical of Home Savings branches.  It exhibits physical integrity and represents the talents of noted artists with its mosaic mural, bronze sculptures and stained glass window which were designed as integral elements of the building and capture the spirit of Santa Monica’s history.  A quorum o f four Landmarks Commissioners participate d in the  February 13, 2017 public h earing on the Lan dmark Designation application .  These four Commissioners had no involvement in the filing of the proactive Designation application in May 2013 or the original public hearing in December 2013 when the Commission designated the building and parcel as a Landmark. O n February 13, 2017 , three of the four members of the Commission present at the public hearing voted to designate the building and parcel at 2600 Wilshire Boulevard as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel based on four o f the six designation criteria.  However, a technical denial resulted because a motion to designate the subject building and parcel as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel failed to receive four votes in the affirmative as required by the Landmarks Commission’s Rules of Order for substantive matters.  This report highlights the points of the appeal, the Landmarks Commission’s action, and staff’s position relative to the designation based on required criteria for designation. 	\N	 Property Description The structure on the subject property is a large, two-story former Home Savings of America building with elements indicative of a blend of Modern and classically formal architecture.  A permit for the building construction was issued on November 17, 1969.  S. David Underwood A.I.A. is listed as architect. The subject property is situated on the southeast corner of Wilshire Boulevard and 26th Street.  The property is surrounded by a gas station to the north, an alley and a one to two-story multi-unit residential building to the south, one-story commercial businesses to the east, and a three-story office building to the west.  The building design is reflective of the collaboration between Howard Ahmanson, businessman and owner of Home Savings, and Millard Sheets, artist and designer, creating buildings that heightened the public’s trust of the financial institution and further allowed the public to embrace the artwork as a reflection of local community history and values. Former Home Savings of America, 2600 Wilshire Boulevard  The former Home Savings building, which is clad in travertine, has a stepped profile with a flat roof, recessed parapet, and a prominent decorative frieze of patterned gold-colored glazed ceramic tiles that wraps around the building. There are full-height window slits on the north and west plaza-facing elevations. T he primary entrance is asymmetrically located on the west façade and consists of a pair of fully glazed metal doors, flanked by floor-to ceiling, fixed glass panels with metal frames. A second entrance on the primary façade consists of glazed metal storefront doors with a substantial travertine surround that projects from the elevation. A secondary entrance from the parking lot is located on the east side of the building. It consists of a pair of fully-glazed metal doors with sidelights, accessed by a flight of concrete steps. A fixed, metal-framed window is located on the Wilshire façade.  Pleasures Along the Beach , Millard Sheets  Directly above the building’s storefront is its primary focal point, a  mural of colored mosaic tiles depicting a beach scene, Pleasures Along the Beach, designed by Millard Sheets.  On the rear south side of the building is a large wall of stained glass, illustrating coastal activities, designed and executed by Susan Hertel.  A rear bronze sculpture, Child with Dolphins by John Edward Svenson  is located above the entrance leading from the east parking area.  At the center of the front plaza facing the street corner is the bronze sculpture Family Group at the Beach by Richard Ellis.   Family Group at the Beach , Richard Ellis   Child with Dolphins , John Edward Svenson   Stained Glass window, designed by Susan Hertel  Over the years, there have been a number of alterations to the building’s exterior. In order to meet ADA requirements, new concrete steps and hand railings leading to the main entrance were installed along with a disabled access ramp east of the steps. A similar non-original ramp leads from the sidewalk along Wilshire Boulevard to the rear east entrance.  Later, when new retail operators replaced the bank, a new second entranc e on the primary façade consisting of glazed metal storefront doors with a substantial travertine surround w as added and the building’s original interior was completely remodeled.  The building’s symmetry was negatively affected by this substantial alteration.  Historic Resources Inventory Status The subject property has not been previously identified as appearing eligible for listing or designation under any criteria in the City’s Historic Resources Inventory (“HRI”) or in any earlier surveys, nor is it located within the boundaries of a potential historic district or grouping.  Landmarks Commission Action On May 13, 2013, in accordance with authority granted under the Landmarks Ordinance, the Landmarks Commission proactively filed an application to consider designation of the former Home Savings building as a City Landmark.  After holding a public hearing, the Landmarks Commission designated the building as a City Landmark on December 9, 2013 and the site as a Landmark Parcel.  The property owner filed a timely appeal on December 13, 2013 contending that the Landmarks Commission wrongly designated the building as a City Landmark and the property as a Landmark Parcel. While the appeal was still pending before the City Council, a new court decision concluded that the proactive designation process used for this property  might be legally problematic because it may not comport with due process requirements. Subsequent to this development in case law, the property owner submitted materials to supplement the previously-filed appeal. On November 1, 2016, City Council upheld the appeal, in part as to certain procedural matters , and remanded the pending Landmark designation application back to the Landmarks Commission. The City Council’s decision did not result in a substantive disapproval of the application. Indeed, the City Council did not consider whether the property met the criteria for designation.  The Landmarks Commission, consisting of a quorum of four Commissioners who were appointed after the initial designation hearing on December 9, 2013, held a Public Hearing on the Landmark Designation application on February 13, 2017. These four Commissioners had no involvement in the filing or review of the original Landmark designation providing the opportunity for an unquestionably neutral determination of the Landmark designation application. As part of the public hearing, the Landmarks Commission , consisting of the quorum of four Commissioners, considered the following materials that are part of the public record:  ·  A City historic consultant report from Historic Resources Group (HRG) prepared in December 2016 that concludes that the property retains its architectural integrity and the integrated artwork, captures the spirit of Santa Monica and represents the talent s of noted artists.  The report recommended that the building in its entirety be designated a City L andmark as the only example of a former Home Savings bank building and related artwork in the City of Santa Monica that was designed or collaboratively designed by Millard Sheets;  ·  A Landmarks Commission staff report that concurs with HRG and recommends designation based on five of the six designation criteria;  ·  Written correspondence from members of the public, including former Landmarks Commissioners and other preservation specialists, offering opinions that strongly encouraged Landmark designation; and  ·  Written correspondence from the property owner’s legal representative, Roger Jon Diamond, that strongly opposed the designation of the building and property, and included an extensive and detailed collection of all prior staff reports, commission minutes, agendas and consultant reports as collected and presented by the, that details the prior history of the building and site when it was previously considered for Landmark Designation. Included with this material is a Landmark Assessment report prepared by the property owner’s historic consultant that concludes that the property is not eligible for designation. Additional attachments were received from Mr. Diamond that are to voluminous to recopy but are available for public review in the Planning Division.  At the hearing, the Commission heard testimony from two members of the public that endorsed the designation of the building and parcel, noting the significance of its integrated artwork which represents the combined vision of businessman Howard Ahmanson and artist Millard Sheets.  An audio excerpt of an interview with Millard Sheet s  was also introduced in the public record by the property owner’s representative in which Mr. Sheets described the mosaic at 2600 Wilshire Boulevard as “satisfactory and also expressed his reservations about the overall size and level of integration of the mosaic on the primary elevation of the building .  During deliberation, members of the Commission d iscussed the significance of the former Home Savings and Loan Bank building and its associated artwork within the context of Santa Monica’s history; recognized the significance of Millard Sheets; identified the building as having a significant presence and a representation of Santa Monica’s history .  Some members expressed concern about the alterations that had occurred to the building , particularly the changes to the west elevation that had diminished the design symmetry, but ultimately concluded  that the  building retained sufficient physical integrity and was still able to visually convey its historic significance .  Members also acknowledged the personal criticism of the mural expressed by its artist Millard Sheets, but further noted that the artwork is still distinctive and well-known throughout the greater Santa Monica community. One Commissioner expressed opposition to the building’s designation, noting that the building offers very little architectural merit, and that the only potential items of merit are some of the art pieces.  A motion to designate the property under five of the six criteria (#s 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) was moved and seconded. A lthough three of the four members of the Commission present at the public hea ring on February 13, 2017 voted to designate the building and parcel at 2600 Wilshire Boulevard as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel based on four of the six designation criteria , a technical denial resulted because a motion to designate the subject building and parcel as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel failed to receive four votes in the affirmative as required by the Landmarks Commission’s Rules of Order for substantive matters .  The final vote on the matter was three (3) ayes, one (1) nay, and three (3) recusals .  The Landmarks Commission’s draft Statement of Official Action is presented as Attachment B. It was not adopted due to a lack of a quorum at the March 13, 2017 meeting. The Commission will consider the Statement of Official Action on April 19, 2017. The February 13, 2017 Landmarks Commission meeting minutes and staff report are presented as Attachments C and D, respectively. The appellant, the Santa Monica Conservancy, filed a timely appeal on February 21, 2017.  In its statement, the appellant concludes that the designation of the subject building as a City Landmark was overwhelmingly supported by the evidence presented in the public record, including the City’s s taff r eport and h istoric c onsultant r eport, local preservation experts, and by a majority of the Commission members present during the public hearing.  The appellant believes that the one dissenting vote cast during the public hearing, which resulted in the technical denial, was arbitrary and subjective, and did not fully take into account the evidence that was presented in support of designation.  Finally, the appellant contends that had Staff , in the written and oral staff reports , indicated to the four Commissioners present during the public hearing that a unanimous vote would be required for designation, a different outcome may have resulted.  Appeal Analysis The Council, in its de novo review of this appeal, is being asked to determine whether the proposed project meets the findings required for Landmark designation identified in SMMC Section 9.56.100. The Council may uphold the appeal or uphold the decision of the Landmarks Commission, in whole or in part, based upon these findings.  As noted above the appellant has identified three points for overturning the Landmarks Commission’s decision. Each statement and staff’s analysis is provided below.  1.  The designation of the subject building as a City Landmark is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence presented in the public record.  The appellant’s conclusion concerning the preponderance of evidence in support of the designation of the former Home Savings building at 2600 Wilshire Boulevard included as part of the public record on the matter, is accurate. The City’s historic consultant, Historic Resources Group (HRG) , was asked to consider the subject property relative to the Landmark Designation criteria and provide its independent analysis and recommendation in the form of a written report for Landmarks Commission consideration.  This report, which was prepared specifically for the remanded hearing and independent of the prior analysis conducted by the City, is included as Attachment E . This report concludes that the subject property meet s five of the six Landmark Designation criteria as specified in the City’s Landmarks Ordinance, and provides detailed recommended findings to support its conclusion.    Additionally, the Staff Report that was prepared for the Landmarks Commission concurs with HRG’s recommendation for designation based on five of the six criteria.  Correspondence and testimony from the general public was also received in advance and during the public hearing, including written letters and emails from individuals who have backgrounds and interest in historic preservation .  This correspondence supported the designation of the property as a City Landmark.  The Commission was also in receipt of written correspondence from the property owner’s legal representative which recommended against designation. Although much of t his correspondence generally challenged the procedural legalit ies of this particular designation application, and the manner and procedures in which it was processed, reviewed and acted upon , a Landmark assessment report, prepared by the property owner’s historic consultant, was included with this material that concluded that the property did not appear to meet any of the City’s Landmark Designation criteria. Staff believes that there was enough evidence in the record to support the Landmark designation and that such a designation could withstand give n the evidence in the record .  2.  The dissenting vote, which resulted in the technical denial, was arbitrary and subjective, and did not fully take into account the evidence that was presented in support of designation.  The City’s Landmark and Historic District Ordinance (Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 9.56) formally establishes a seven-member Landmarks Commission as a quasi-judicial, discretionary body, whose membership is appointed by the City Council.  This Ordinance delegates certain power and authority to this Landmarks Commission to advance historic preservation goals throughout the City, including the power to designate a structure, improvement, natural feature or object as a Landmark based on qualifying criteria. SMMC Section 9.56.100  describes the Landmark designation criteria .  W hen conducting a Landmarks designation hearing, the Landmarks Commission is asked to determine whether based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the property meets one or more of the criteria set forth in SMMC 9.56.100.  In doing so, indivi dual Commissioners exercise their independent judgment when applying the evidence to the criteria.   During the February 13, 2017 hearing on the matter of the Landmark Designation application for the former Home Savings building only four Commissioners were able to be seated for the public hearing .  On a motion to designate the building and site as a Landmark and Landmark Parcel, one Commissioner, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, determined that the property did not meet any criteria in SMMC 9.56.100 .  This Commissioner was presented with all the same information as the rest of the Commissioners present at the hearing, clearly articulat ing their opinion that the former Home Savings building is monolithic in appearance and brutal in its approach, and lacked any architectural merit. This Commissioner further suggested that the only items of potential merit would be the art pieces, specifically the sculptures . This vote was not arbitrary and unsubstantiated. This Commissioner stated his opinion for the record that the building lack ed architectural merit and could not make the required findings, but that there may be historic significance to certain features found on the property (i.e. some of the artwork) as described in all of the reports and testimony.  However, since the motion offered was for the designation of the building and site in its entirety as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel, this Commissioner did not support the motion as presented.  3.  If staff had indicated in written and oral staff reports to the Landmarks Commission that a unanimous vote would be required for Landmarks designation, a different outcome may have resulted.  The Landmarks Commission has adopted Rules of Order to inform the Commission on its protocol and conduct while carrying out Commission business.  These Rules provide specific guidance that require a vote of at least four members to carry out substantive matters, without exception (Rule 2).  The approval of a Landmark Designation is a substantive matter.  Although the circumstances and prior history of this specific designation application is complex and unusual, there isn’t a noted exception to allow the designation of a Landmark to occur without a vote of four members in support regardless of the number of Commissioners present to hear a matter.  Although in hindsight, staff accepts that this fact could have been reiterated in its Staff Report, staff believes the fact that it wasn’t has no bearing on the expressed opinions of the individual Commissioners.   Conclusion From the onset, the model for the construction of Home Savings branches, as dictated by owner Howard Ahmanson, was to instill public trust and confidence in the banking institution and still reflect traditional family and community values.  This was achieved through marrying art and architecture with building design.  Each aspect w as integral to creating a unique and cohesive design that was indicative of the Home Savings brand and model.  In addition, the building, with its clean lines and lack of ornamentation, acts as a frame that allows the artwork to standout prominently, particularly the mural.  It has been stated that other extant examples in the region are architecturally superior (the original prototype branch located in Beverly Hills) and/or exhibit a higher level of historic integrity (the Anaheim branch, which is nearly identical) than the Santa Monica building.  While these may better reflect the ideals and imagery that is representative of the former Home Savings of America, the City has no jurisdiction or ability to exert any protections over these outlying buildings.  The City of Santa Monica has one extant former Home Savings and it is the City Council’s charge to determine if this specific resource tells a distinct story reflective of Santa Monica’s unique history based upon the criteria described in SMMC Section 9.56.100 of the Landmarks Ordinance.  In applying the City’s significance criteria for individual recognition as a proposed City of Santa Monica Landmark, the s taff believe s that the building meets the threshold for Landmark designation based on five of the City’s designation criteria. Therefore, s taff recommends that the City Council grant the appeal and designate the former Home Savings building as a City Landmark and the subject property as a Landmark Parcel based upon the findings required by SMMC Section 9.56.100:   (1)  It exemplifies, symbolizes, or manifests elements of the cultural, social, economic, political or architectural history of the City.   The property symbolizes a period of Santa Monica’s postwar architectural history.  Specifically, the property is an example of postwar bank architecture and is one of only two examples of a Home Savings and Loan branch office with a modified v-shaped, projecting-wing building plan designed by artist Millard Sheets in collaboration with architect S. David Underwood.  The building was constructed in a period of rapid expansion and growth for the Home Savings and Loan Association.  The monumental massing, formal symmetrical façade arrangements, high quality materials and integrated artwork, including one of the largest mosaic murals commissioned by Home Savings, is representative of the Home Savings building program that resulted in some of the most iconic and recognizable buildings in Southern California.  Although there have been some minor alterations, the integrity of the structure remains high in terms of location, design, setting, workmanship, feeling, and association. Further, the character-defining features on the building exterior and site remain intact including:  ·  Plaza paved in exposed-aggregate concrete ·  Circular, tiered planter with bronze sculpture ·  Wide, raised terrace with a battered masonry wall, integral raised planters, and wide concrete steps  ·  Two-story volume and symmetrical composition ·  V-shaped plan ·  Complex massing consisting of a tall, high volume central pavilion with a hexagonal plan, flanked by lower two-story volume wings with rectangular plans  ·  Flat roofs with low parapets ·  Exterior walls clad in travertine slabs ·  Continuous friezes of textured ceramic tile, bordered by travertine fillets ·  Clusters of fixed, metal-framed, vertical strip windows with wide travertine mullions  ·  Large stained-glass window on the east façade ·  Floor-to-ceiling, fixed glass panels with metal frames at primary entrance ·  Mosaic tile mural directly above the primary entrance ·  Secondary entrance from the parking lot with a pair of fully-glazed metal doors with sidelights, and concrete steps with battered masonry cheek walls ·  Wall-mounted bronze sculpture  Although the Home Savings branches built during the postwar era had similar qualities to maintain design continuity, the Santa Monica location is distinguished by the orientation of the building to the street corner and the works of art that reference the local Santa Monica beach culture.  (2)  It has aesthetic or artistic interest or value, or other noteworthy interest or value.  The property includes examples of artwork which are unique to the Santa Monica location and are distinguished by their size and arrangement on the projecting-wing building plan.  The most prominent work is the 40-foot wide mosaic mural on the primary façade depicting local themes including swimming, yachting, fishing, and beach games.  The themes established in the mosaic influenced the remainder of the artwork on the property including a plaza fountain topped by a bronze sculpture of a family at play in the surf.  Another bronze sculpture of a child with dolphin decorates the east-facing façade along with a stained-glass window that was intended to give a kaleidoscope of beach activity depicting swimming, beach games, and figures with animals located on the south elevation. The size of the mosaic mural represents a departure from the Millard Sheets’ traditional aesthetic of smaller vignettes across a field of darker material.  As such, the property has aesthetic and artistic value because not only is the mural an unusual example of large-scale artwork within the Home Savings building program, but the projecting-wing building plan was also atypical and is a distinctive feature of the property. While other branch buildings were characterized by building wings that usually project from the secondary façade creating elongated rectangular plans, the Santa Monica branch incorporates the familiar Home Savings design elements integrated with a modified v-plan and plaza that makes the subject property noteworthy, and as such, it also possesses artistic and aesthetic value.  (4)  It embodies distinguishing architectural characteristics valuable to a study of a period, style, method of construction, or the use of indigenous materials or craftsmanship, or is a unique or rare example of an architectural design, detail or historical type valuable to such a study.  The Santa Monica Home Savings Building is an excellent local example of the postwar building program set forth by the Home Savings and Loan Association.  During the 1950s to 1970s, Home Savings embarked on an ambitious building program that started with the completion of the 1956 branch office in Beverly Hills.  Public reaction was so positive that instead of expansion through acquisition, Howard Ahmanson, founder of Home Savings and Loan Association, decided expansion would occur through construction of new branch offices in high-demand areas. The building designs came to represent Home Savings’ corporate identity with continuity in its readily-identifiable monumental form, cladding, fenestration, and location-specific artwork.  The Santa Monica branch is unique in terms of its high volume central pavilion with projecting wings resulting in a distinctive, modified v-shaped plan.  The Santa Monica Home Saving Building is one of only two known examples of this type (the other was constructed in Anaheim) and is therefore the only example of its kind in Los Angeles County.  (5)  It is a significant or a representative example of the work or product of a notable builder, designer or architect.   The building was designed by Millard Sheets, who was a prominent Southern California artist, in collaboration with architect S. David Underwood.  Sheets’ use of integrated artwork in his commercial building designs attracted the attention of Howard Ahmanson who commissioned him to design a series of branch offices for Home Savings.  The branch offices of the Home Savings and Loan Association represented the introduction of integrated artwork into the commercial aesthetic with links to local culture through references to location-specific themes and motifs. The monumental massing, formal symmetrical façade arrangements, high quality materials and integrated artwork came to define Home Savings’ corporate identity making the branch offices instantly recognizable.  Over his nearly thirty-year involvement with Home Savings, Sheets designed over forty branch locations in California including new construction, renovations, and the installation of artwork in temporary locations.  (6)  It has a unique location, a singular physical characteristic, or is an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood, community or the City.  The Santa Monica branch of the Home Savings and Loan Association is readily-identifiable by its monumental form and aesthetic, and situated on the parcel with its primary volume and entrance oriented at a 45-degree angle to a prominent corner street (west primary façade).  Compared to other Home Savings branch offices, the Santa Monica branch office is unusual and noteworthy for its orientation and building plan. Furthermore, with its distinctive and prominent artwork and associations with the corporate identity of the Home Savings and Loan Association, the building is an established and familiar visual feature at the southeast corner of Wilshire Boulevard and 26 th Street.  Alternatives As a de novo matter before the City Council, the Council may consider other options which it deems appropriate, including denying L andmark designation, or designating specific components of the building and/or site individually or collectively, based upon the testimony and evidence presented in the full public record.  Environmental Analysis The project is exempt pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3).  Section 15061(b)(3) provides that CEQA only applies to those projects that have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment.  Since the proposed action would result in the retention of the existing structure and would not change the existing environmental baseline, there is no potential that the project would cause a significant effect on the environment.  Public Outreach The public notice for this hearing concerning 2600 Wilshire Boulevard was published at least 10 days prior to the hearing in the Santa Monica Daily Press and mailed to all property owners and occupants within 300 feet of the subject property. 	\N	10

68	Resolution Making Findings of Local Climatic, Geological and Topographical Conditions and Introduce for First Reading an Ordinance Updating Seismic Retrofit Requirements for Potentially Seismically Vulnerable Buildings, Updating Tenant Protection Laws and Implementing a Seismic Retrofit Program	Building & Safety (PCD)	\N	On December 6, 2016, City Council conducted a Study Session on the degree of seismically vulnerable buildings 1 in Santa Monica that are subject to damage or collapse in a seismic event.  The Staff Report of the Study Session, provided herein as Attachment D, provided the total number of unretrofitted buildings that were identified as potentially seismically vulnerable.  Council was presented with recommendations for updates to the City’s 1999 retrofit standards and recommendations for a fully active Seismic Retrofit Program.  City Council instructed staff to proceed with the development of an ordinance that provides updates to the standards for seismic retrofit and implement ation of a Seismic Retrofit Program.  The proposed ordinance also includes compliance timeframes, notification procedures, and measures for increased tenant protections.  Council instructed staff to research previous Federal and State grant funding related to seismic retrofit and if such grants are still available.           ______________________________________________________________________ 1 The categories of Seismically Vulnerable Buildings and existing Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapters are as follows: ·  Unreinforced Masonry Bearing Wall Buildings (Chapter 8.60) ·  Reinforced Concrete or Masonry Wall Buildings with Flexible Diaphragms (Chapter 8.64) ·  Single-Family Dwellings, Strengthening of Cripple Walls and Sill Plate Anchorage (Chapter 8.68) ·  Soft, Weak, or Open Front Wall in Wood-Framed Buildings (Chapter 8.72) ·  Welded Steel Moment Frame Buildings (Chapter 8.76) ·  Non-Ductile Concrete Buildings (Chapter 8.80) ____________________________________________________________________________________ 	A fundamental expectation in the occupancy of residential and commercial structures is that buildings are safe and free from hazard.  Buildings that provide resistance to the destructive forces of earthquakes and aftershocks are an essential component in building safety and occupancy.  Strengthening of older less resistant buildings is necessary in order to provide the structural resiliency to increase occupant safety.  An update to the City’s existing seismic retrofit standards and implementing retrofit requirements for potentially vulnerable buildings would provide increased measures of occupant safety.  The proposed ordinance, Attachment A, provides updates of the seismic retrofit requirements adopted by the City Council on June 8, 1999.   Both California state laws regulating Building Code adoption and California Health and Safety Code Sections 19101 and 19162-63.6 authorize local jurisdictions to establish mandatory seismic retrofit standards.  Pursuant to Section 18941.5 of the California Health and Safety Code , amendments to the California Building Standards Code are required to be justified by local climatic, geological and topographical conditions.  The attached Resolution with proposed local findings is provided in Attachment B.  Staff has identified buildings that may be potentially seismically vulnerable and has represented these buildings in an inventory (List) provided as Attachment C.  The Seismic Retrofit Program (Program) will target these identified unretrofitted buildings where Program compliance and enforcement will be required in conformance with the schedule outlined in the ordinance.  Retrofitting seismically vulnerable buildings is proposed through an active and ongoing Seismic Retrofit Program.  The Program will includ e identification, notification, compliance procedures, and residential tenant protections.  In addition, timely processing and compliance will also require consultant services to provide structural plan check and peer review of complex structural retrofit designs. Should Council adopt the Resolution and Ordinance, staff will initiate a Request f or Proposal for the procurement of engineering consultant services to address processing of seismic retrofit plans and to maintain expected service levels in construction permitting .  The proposed ordinance also seeks revisions to Chapter 8.100 Tenant Protection During Construction and Chapter 4.36 Tenant Relocation Assistance.  Revisions to these Chapters will enhance existing tenant protections and incorporate measure s for hazardous material cases.  A proposed revision includes addressing issues related to hazardous materials found in older construction materials.  Additional proposed revisions will also require building owners to pay for environmental consulting services in the determination and resolution of hazardous materials.  To address this issue, staff is recommending the issuance of a Request for Proposal for the procurement of environmental consultant services.  Since construction work has the potential to impact existing residential tenants, passage of the seismic retrofit ordinance and the resulting construction has the potential to create impacts to existing tenants.   The implementation of the Program will include means for tenant advocacy and advisory. All affected City Departments will engage in the support of residential tenants and the response to retrofit compliances. Retrofitting, or the strengthening of the structural system of older seismically vulnerable buildings increases the lateral load resisting system in these older buildings allowing better performance in earthquakes and aftershocks.  Better performance will significantly reduce the potential for building damage and collapse, lessening the occurrences of occupant injury or death.  The updates to the technical standards for seismic retrofit in the proposed ordinance are recommended to improve performance of buildings to levels similar to minimum life-safety levels of the State building code.  Although minimum life-safety levels of seismic retrofit does not eliminate the possibility of injury or death due to building damage, the proposed standards would result in substantial gains in protecting the City’s inhabitants, workers and visitors. Seismic Retrofit Program Implementation List – Potentially Seismically Vulnerable Buildings At the December 6, 2016 Study Session, staff presented to Council that the identification and inventory (List) of potentially seismically vulnerable buildings will be available in January 2017.  The List was made publically available on January 26, 2017 on a City webpage dedicated to the Seismic Retrofit Program.  As indicated on the List, all types of seismically vulnerable buildings will be targeted for notification, structural analysis and if found to be deficient, the requirement to complete retrofit of the building.  The List is an inventory of buildings that may require retrofit based on determination through building permit records and visual identification.  In addition, the List will be dynamic as a structural analysis of some buildings may find that a building does not require retrofit in which case the building would be removed from the list.  Likewise, buildings not currently on the List may someday be identified as requiring retrofit when structural systems are revealed during tenant modifications to the buildings.  The List will serve as a basis in the milestone steps towards retrofit compliance with iterative steps noted once completed.  Notification, Time Limits and Recordation of Properties Owners of buildings on the List will be notified that their building has been identified as potentially seismically vulnerable.  Once notified , a building owner will be required to provide a structural analysis of the building and a recommendation for a retrofit solution, if necessary.  The notification will serve as the official commencement of the time period in which the building owner has to comply with milestones of compliance.  The proposed ordinance identifies priorities of hazardous building types in which notification will be phased by order of hazard severity, compliance timeframe and building type.  The phasing of the notices will allow for the segmenting of 4,594 notices to building owners. The overall compliance time limit is provided per bu ilding type in the table below.  Potentially Seismically V ulnerable Buildings Type Years to Complete Retrofit Unreinforced Masonry Buildings 2 Years Concrete Tilt-Up Buildings 3 Years Soft-Story Buildings 6 Years Non-Ductile Concrete Buildings 10 Years Steel Moment Frame Buildings 20 Years Single-Family Brace and Bolts Voluntary             In the case of multiple ownership of a building where a building consists of multiple parcels such as condominiums, each owner of a parcel will receive a notice.  The List identifies condominium buildings by legal address with individual parcels.  The proposed ordinance includes major milestones in the process of seismic retrofitting of a building.  The milestones include interim deadlines that will allow for compliance monitoring.  Consultation by staff will be available to advise the small family-owned residential owners and small business/building owners with information necessary for understanding the steps of compliance in the retrofit process. At the December 6, 2016 Study Session, Council directed staff to examine the effects of a recorded notice on the title of a property.  Staff explored if a recording will introduce constraints from lending institutions on property loans and discovered that there will be no significant effect.  Staff is r ecommend ing that the proposal for a recorded notice will be a positive factor in the achievement of retrofit compliance as well as fair disclosure to parties involved in the affected properties.  Staff will propose general language on the notice to be recorded with the County of Los Angeles Office of the Registrar/Recorder as to not overburden impact on title transfers and the securing of loans including loans for the financing of seismic retrofit.  Both the City of Los Angeles and the City and County of San Francisco have included recordation of seismic retrofit requirements in their process.  Consultant Services Buildings with complex structural systems, such as the Steel Moment Frame and Non-Ductile Concrete buildings will have detailed complicated retrofit solutions.  Complex retrofit designs will require peer review which is a standard practice in structural design of complicated buildings.  Peer review is the process where an independent structural engineer reviews the design of a retrofit plan and provides input to best practices in the structural design of a project.  Peer review is a detailed highly-technical exercise involving specialized expertise that should be handled by consultant services.  Therefore, staff recommend s incorporating the procedure of peer review as a necessary part of seismic retrofit.  Costs for peer review will be proposed and presented to the City Council as part of the FY 2017-19 biennial budget.   In addition to peer review, the volume of plans anticipated for seismic retrofit will require consulting services for the plan check of seismic retrofit designs.  The consulting services will augment Building and Safety staff, as-needed, for the plan review of large complex buildings and for peak submittals of plans.  Funding for consultant plan check will be incorporated with the FY 2017-19 biennial City budget.  It is recommended that City Council authorize staff to issue a Request for Proposal s for consultant services for seismic retrofit plan check and peer review.  Parking Effects The structural strengthening of a building related to seismic retrofit may have an effect on parking spaces by reducing the dimensions of a required parking space or in some cases eliminating required parking.  Where the retrofit solution provides that there is no alternate practical solutions to a retrofit, the proposed ordinance provides that the Zoning Administrator may reduce the required size of a parking space or the number of required spaces.  The proposal is that parking shall not be reduced more than twenty-percent (20%) of required parking spaces or one (1 ) space, whichever is greater.  Tenant Protection Protection of tenants and the stock of affordable housing in the City are of paramount importance.  Construction in residential buildings, if not conducted or monitored with diligence could be of significant impact to tenants. The proposed ordinance provides for several amendments to strengthen tenant protections for standard ongoing construction projects, and for construction related to the Seismic Retrofit Program.  Added requirements and revisions to Chapters 8.100 and 4.36 are presented as part of the proposed ordinance. Enhancements to Tenant Protection During Construction, Chapter 8.100 The following proposed revisions to Chapter 8.100 are purposed to enhance protection of tenants during construction activity. ·  Older buildings are likely to contain building materials of hazardous content and if disturbed, can be of detrimental effect to humans and possibly pets.  Materials such as asbestos and lead paint may still be present in some of the buildings that require seismic retrofit.  Existing State Law procedures require a building owner to abate hazardous materials in accordance with procedures of the Southern California Air Quality Management District (AQMD).  Proper adherence to these procedures should provide tenants with the assurance that hazardous materials are abated and no longer pose a health threat. Staff proposes to add additional requirements to Chapter 8.100 to: (1) clarify that owners must ensure that all hazardous materials are properly handled during construction;  (2) the City will actively monitor such handling;  and (3) the City may reasonable engage the services of qualified experts, at the owner’s expense, to assist the City in evaluating the owner’s compliance. ·  Relatedly, staff also request that the City Council instruct staff to initiate a Request for Proposal s to procure the services of licensed environmental consultants as advisors to the City on issues of hazardous materials. ·  Section 8.100.040(c)(9) requires a building owner to provide monthly notices to tenants on construction progress for projects that exceed thirty-days of construction.  This section also allows the Building Officer to request meetings to allow tenant feedback to construction issues.  Proposed with this ordinance is clarifying that the request of the Building Officer is not appealable given the timeliness of a requested meeting and tenant concerns.  Enhancements to Tenant Relocation Assistance, Chapter 4.36 The following clarifications and enhancements are proposed to Chapter 4.36 to address improvements and revisions in tenant relocation. ·  For short-term tenant displacements (e.g. due to inoperable equipment such as hot water heating or environmental heat ) a proposal to allow owners to relocate tenants to a hotel is presented in the ordinance.  The relocation to a hotel would be an option instead of paying the daily per diem, or providing comparable housing if relocation is estimated to be five days or less. Tenants would be entitled to per diem payments or be relocated to comparable accommodations if relocation extends beyond five days.  Staff is proposing five days as a measure for timely relocations as staff determined that the majority of relocations are typically at five days or less. ·  Existing law does not require owners to expeditiously repair tenant units while tenants are relocated.  In some relocation cases, the extent of a tenant being relocated was not proportionate to the estimated time to address the condition causing the relocation.  A proposal to require a  maximum time limit in which a tenant is relocated is included in the ordinance.  The estimated maximum time frame will be based on the condition causing relocation as determined by the Building Officer.  Should the estimated time limit be exceeded, an investigation will be warranted to determine causes for the delay.  Where relocation is in excess of the estimated time limit without reasonable cause, the Code Enforcement Division would initiate enforcement action. ·  As timely resolution is desired in a relocation case to remedy conditions of uninhabitability, added language to Chapter 4.36 is proposed to ensure that the owner has access to the rental unit and have the opportunity to timely address the condition without interference from the tenant.  This is proposed to address recent issues where building owners were prevented by a tenant from making necessary repairs causing relocations to be prolonged. Staff asserts that this allowance will provide for timely resolutions. ·  Sections 4.36.120(c) and (d) currently do not allow relocation benefits when a tenant is displaced as a result of seismic retrofit.  Research determined that this language was written in the 1999 seismic retrofit ordinance.  It was included in hopes of incentivizing owners to commence retrofitting; however, experience has shown that this incentive is ineffective and that it unnecessarily burdens tenants.  Staff proposes that this Section be repealed to meet current relocation goals of the City.  Eliminating this provision will likely also encourage more timely completion of seismic retrofit projects.  Exemptions to Zonal Restrictions on Construction Due to the mandated timeline contained in the seismic retrofit ordinance, it is possible that seismic retrofit of several multi-family buildings may occur simultaneously.  However, local law (namely the Construction Rate Program of Chapter 9.37.110) only allows one project (involving the new construction or alteration of 2 or more dwelling units in the R2, R3, R4, OF, RMH, OPD, OP2, OP3, and OP4 Districts) to occur within a 500-foot radius at a time.  This restriction could have a negative impact on the retrofit compliance efforts of multi-family buildings.  Although Section 9.37.110 contains an exemption for seismic retrofit projects, that exemption only applies to unreinforced masonry type buildings.  The proposed ordinance seeks to override this prohibition and allow all seismic retrofit projects to proceed simultaneously.  Tenant and Occupant Advisory The proposed ordinance includes a requirement that building owners must notify each residential and commercial tenant when the Building Officer determines that a building is seismically vulnerable and subject to retrofit to comply with local law.  This notice is an advisory to tenants and will include references to contacts in the City for assistance.  As part of milestone compliance, the building owner is required to provide the Department with evidence that each tenant has been provided with the tenant advisory related to seismic retrofit.  For buildings that will require retrofit construction, Chapter 8.100 currently requires posting of Construction Notification (on a 30-inch by 40-inch poster) that states effects during the construction and interruptions to building services.   Public Assistance, Public Information Staff will be available for general and detailed questions for each aspect of compliance with the Program.  To assist with general information, a webpage dedicated to the Seismic Retrofit Program in already available on the City’s website. Webpage On January 26, 2017, the Department launched the Seismic Retrofit Program webpage which includes the List of potentially seismically vulnerable buildings.  Should Council adopt the ordinance, the webpage will be updated with program information for owners and tenants.  Other information planned for the webpage will include financing information for loan assistance for seismic retrofit.  This will include the seven private financiers listed on the Resolution that City Council approved on February 23, 2016 as indicated in the Study Session report.  Planned with Council’s passage of the ordinance is a Seismic Retrofit Fair where building owners, residential and commercial tenants and business merchants may obtain information about the Seismic Retrofit Program in a “one stop” event.  In addition to City staff, financiers, product vendors, consulting architects and engineers, and building contractors who specialize in seismic retrofit will have a presence at the Fair.  The webpage will provide event dates, and information related to the Seismic Retrofit Fair. A major component in achieving compliance of the Seismic Retrofit Program is the timely completion of a building retrofit.  A key factor in timely compliance is staff’s ability to process applications, structural reports, seismic design plans and the issuance of building permits. Three additional positions will provide the needed resources to address additional workload such as resident and owner services, application-notification-recordation processing, structural engineering analysis and customer guidance.  The positions will be covered with new revenues and presented as part of the FY 2017-19 biennial budget process.   Cost and Financing of Retrofit The Study Session Staff Report contained approximate costs for seismic retrofit.  Staff reported at the Study Session that State Assembly Bill 837 set up the California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program Fund for residences and small businesses related to seismic retrofit.  This Bill is now codified as California Health a nd Safety Code 44559.14 and provides another source of financing for seismic retrofit. At the December 6, 2016 Study Session, Council asked if previous seismic retrofit funding after the 1994 Northridge Earthquake from the Federal and State governments granted to building owners in Santa Monica might still be available.  Research found that many buildings were retrofitted utilizing grant monies, however, the funds are no longer available.  Rent Control Board Hearing Should City Council adopt the proposed ordinance, following the second reading of the ordinance, the Rent Control Board will be presented with a request to determine the extent of pass-through costs of retrofit work to tenants.  The Rent Control Board will be asked to determine if pass-through costs should be included as part of monthly tenant rents, and if so, the percentage of retrofit cost attributed to the pass-through, the total term and the maximum monthly pass-through costs.  CEQA Exemption The proposed ordinance is categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to Sections 15061(b)(3), 15301 and 15302 of the CEQA Guidelines.  Section 15301 provides exemption for a class of projects (Class 1) consisting of repair, maintenance or minor alterations to public or private structures or facilities involving negligible or no expansion of use.  Section 15302 provides exemption for a class of projects (Class 2) consisting of replacement or reconstruction of existing structures or facilities where the new structure or facility will be located on the same site and will have substantially the same purpose and capacity.  The proposed ordinance requires repair, maintenance and minor alterations of existing structures and facilities to meet minimum seismic safety standards.  The ordinance does not require or contemplate any appreciable expansion or change in use or capacity of any existing structure or facility.  Accordingly, the ordinance is categorically exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Sections 15301 and 15302.  Additionally, the proposed ordinance is also exempt pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3) because, as described by this Staff Report, it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the proposed ordinance could have a significant effect on the environment.  	\N	14
52	Pier Use Study and Twilight Concert Series Update	Pier Management, Housing and Economic Development	The City and Santa Monica Pier Corporation (SMPC) engaged ROMA Design Group to prepare a Pier Use Study (Study) and assist the SMPC with facilitating an intensive eight-month public process to develop a series of realistic and actionable short-term and mid-term recommendations to help the Santa Monica Pier best respond to and leverage the changing environment brought about by the recently completed Phase 2 Expo Line and Colorado Esplanade, as well as the upcoming replacement of the Pier Bridge and the update of the Local Coastal Program (LCP). The emphasis of this effort is to sustain and enhance the character of the Pier as an attractive public environment that continues to welcome locals and visitors of all backgrounds and incomes to share and experience an iconic embodiment of California’s historic heritage, natural environment and cultural diversity.  Additi onally, guidance from the SMPC B oard is provided in a companion document (Board Recommendations) which summa rizes and categorizes the SMPC B oard’s recommendations reflecting both ROMA’s work and the B oard’s knowledge of the Pier and City practices. The SMPC’s expectation is that the Bo ard Recommendations and Study (A ttachments A and B) would provide guidance not only on the update of the LCP, but for all matters concerning the Pier.  The Twilight Concert Series (TCS) has grown significantly over the past decade, as have the related impacts to public safety, traffic, the beach, and associated costs.  City staff  met with board members and staff of the Santa Monica Pier Corporation (SMPC)  in  2015 regarding the 2015 and 2016 TCS . They have been meeting again since December 2016 to identify changes for the 2017 series to reduce the adverse impacts and to seek cost reductions to sustain a long-standing community tradition.  The changes for 2017 include reducing the number of concerts from ten to eight, beginning the series earlier to avoid the summer peak season, implementing a traffic plan and encourag ing attendees to use active transportation, setting up a more extensive and on-going planning and coordination process among City staff , Pier Corporation staff , and event producers , and developing a campaign to reduce the amount of trash on the  beach. As part of the proposed FY 2017-2019 budget, staff will recommend  an allocation in the amount of $600,000 to cover City - related costs. Staff will return to the Council in fall 2017 with a full report on the TCS series , an evaluation of the changes , and a request for direction regarding the future of the TCS. 	The Santa Monica Pier is a unique waterfront and historic resource that brings together people from all walks of life. As one of the City’s and region’s most enduring and successful public spaces, the Pier serves many functions and uses, including being a public amenity with active and passive recreation and a platform for events, artistic expression, fishing, coastal access, and a connection to history.  The Twilight Concert Series (TCS) was launched nearly four decades ago as part of the effort to “bring back” the Pier, which had been saved by citizen action from planned demolition. Over that time, it played a key role in that success and become a signature summer series concert tradition , featuring a broad range of musical acts on Thursday nights. It has grown to attract visitors from throughout the Los Angeles area , who enjoy the TCS from the Pier and adjacent beach. That growth has gradually expanded beyond the Pier itself to cover a wide swath of beach to the south.  The Pier ’s attractions include  commercial enterprise s, including an amusement park, arcade, aquarium, and many restaurants, shops, and unique experiences including a historic hippodrome and carousel. It also features the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium, a non-profit educational institution devoted to ocean and environmental science education. Annual visitor counts prior to the opening of Phase 2 of the Expo Light Rail Line were estimated at over seven million people; with the completion of the Expo Line in May of 2016, Pier tenants and Pier staff have reported a substantial increase in Pier visitation.  Context for the Pier Use Study The impetus for the Pier Use Study (Study) originated from the City’s and SMPC’s interest in proactively identifying how the Pier and its related operations could be updated in light of several transformative projects, starting with the arrival of Phase 2 Expo Line light rail and the completion of Colorado Esplanade, which collectively have increased access and brought thousands more visitors to the Pier on a daily basis.  In addition, the upcoming replacement of the Pier Bridge and the update of the Local Coastal Program (LCP) are seen as critical components to enable the City to further reshape the way millions of visitors will access and experience the historic venue and public resource.  The Pier Bridge replacement project and LCP prioritize pedestrian and bicycle access by repurposing areas of the Pier previously devoted to vehicle circulation and parking  in favor of other uses .  The  Pier B ridge replacement project provides the means to minimize conflicts among pedestrians, bicyclists, and automobiles accessing the Pier by creating separate areas for these modes of travel .  The LCP is a two-part document that consists of a Land Use Plan (LUP) and an Implementation Plan. The  new LUP plan, if adopted by Council and subsequently by the Coastal Commission, would update the 1992 Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan and establish new coastal access policies including parking policies. The Implementation Plan would be a zoning document which sets the land-use standards with which development in the C oastal Z one must comply.  The draft Land Use Plan and the draft Environmental Impact Report ( EIR ) for the Pier B ridge replacement are  expected to be presented to Council later this year.   Consultants and Study Process ROMA Design Group, designer of many notable public spaces including Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade and San Francisco’s Ferry Building,  was selected to facilitate the public process that paired the consultant team’s technical expertise with input from engaged stakeholders and community members.  The preparation of the Study was organized around a series of three community workshops hosted by the Santa Monica Pier Corporation on June 3, 2015, September 21, 2015, and December 2, 2015. Upon  completion of the Study, the SMPC Board prepared a companion document that distilled ROM A’s work in the context of the Board’s experience .  The companion d ocument that was approved by the Board on December 17, 2015. 	 While there are many benefits of increased visitation, more visitors necessitate an increase in the level of services on the Pier .  A s a waterfront structure, the Pier itself requires a continually higher level of maintenance and repair as the structure is subjected to the additional stresses caused by increased visitation, climate change, and sea-level rise.  Recommendations in the attached documents include physical improvements to enhance the visitors ’ experience , suggestions for new uses and activities that could improve the Pier’s financial performance, and additional approaches to improve environmental sustainability of the Pier.  The objective of the Study was not to prepare a “master plan” or “specific plan” ( plans that may be needed at a future time ), but rather to offer actionable and forward-thinking ideas and priorities that could be implemented by the City incrementally as interest, opportunity, and funding allow . In addition, the Study introduce s ideas to be vetted by other formal planning documents and public works initiatives such as the LCP and Pier Bridge EIR analysis.  The Study and SMPC recommendations are aimed to support the Pier’s continued vibrancy and vitality, as well as promote improved fiscal and environmental sustainability. The Study is not a review of the Pier’s compliance under the Americans with Disabilities Act Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title 24 of the California Building Code or any similar law. Should the City adopt some or all of the SMPC board recommendations, SMPC anticipates that the City w ould perform the required studies to ensure that the recommendations comply with such laws. The SMPC Board understands that not all of the proposed recommendations may be realized, and the recommendations that could be realized may require further study and discussion.  The SMPC Board prepared a Board Recommendations document to serve as a concise companion piece to summarize both the findings in the Study and the Board’s experience with the Pier.  The Board Recommendations are presented in five categories: 1) Access and Circulation, 2) Uses and Activities, 3) Financial Sustainability, 4) Environmental Sustainability, and 5) Regulatory.  Notable findings in the Study and reaffirmed in the Board Recommendations include the following:  ·  Reduction of Parking on Pier Deck Parking Lot : the vision presented in the Study calls for reducing the parking area to improve the layout of the lot and provide pathways that would better buffer pedestrians from cars. Shrinking the parking area could add dedicated community gathering space while allow ing the remainder of the pier deck parking area to be use as ‘flex space’ that could be used for parking , community programing , or other activities (see page 7 in Attachment A for Opportunity Area Map).  The SMPC Board recommends the Pier Deck parking lost in the reconfiguration be relocated to the Deauville Lot north of the Pier. Parking policies set by the LCP would need to be revised to reflect the reduction of parking spaces on the Pier for existing and new uses on the Pier.  ·  Opportunity Areas : the Study identified five activity areas on the Pier where the quality and diversity of activities could be enhanced.  1)  Area 1 - Education/Children’s Activity Area: create a family-friendly area adjacent to Ocean Front Walk and the Carousel.  2)  Area 2 - Market Place/Event Space Activity Area: create a continuous pedestrian Pier Walk experience with a new ground-level Market Hall, ground-level shops, and a second-level Event Center that would replace the area currently used as the parking lot entrance/exit and ‘back of house’ maintenance facilities.  3)  Area 3 - Recreation and Amusement Activity Area: create a permanent recreational/amusement/spectator use that complements adjacent uses and is capable of improving pedestrian flow.  4)  Area 4 – Flexible  Open - Space - Activity Area: repurpose the west side of the pier parking lot and the eastern edge of Pacific Park to create an important gateway to the amusement activities and create a more positive connection to the parking area as a flexible open space.  5)  Area 5 - Vending Cart and Outdoor Dining Zones: create additional vending cart opportunities and outdoor dining extension zones to bring more activity and continuity to pedestrian movement along the length of the Pier Walk.  ·  Pier Bridge Replacement Project - the SMPC continues to endorse the two-bridge proposal (Colorado Avenue and Moss Avenue bridges) which could prioritize pedestrian access and safety by separating pedestrians and bicycles from vehicles and could also unlock new opportunities for activities and uses on the Pier by allowing the Pier to reclaim areas that had previously been used for vehicle movement and parking. However, the SMPC recommendation presents a design refinement to the Pier Bridge Replacement Project and is summarized below .   The SMPC recommends that the two-bridge design should:  1)  Incorporate an elevator, escalators, and a staircase within the Colorado Ave Bridge, rather than a ramping system, to enhance multifaceted access to the Pier. The addition of an elevator, escalator, and staircase would better accommodate the continuous and high-volume flow of pedestrians on to and off the Pier.  2)  E xtend the Colorado Esplanade bike lanes on to the Colorado Avenue Bridge and connect with the Beach Bike Path.  Pier Bridge Replacement EIR An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) analysis of different bridge designs to replace the Pier Bridge is currently underway and will be brought to Council for review and comment at a future date. The  preferred alternative in the EIR is a project that replaces the Pier Bridge with a bridge that would serve bikes, pedestrians, emergency vehicles, and limited deliveries, coupled with a second bridge at Moss Avenue to serve vehicles entering the parking area , all in compliance with applicable law and codes . As referenced above, the two-bridge option eliminates the main source of pedestrian/ vehicular conflict on the Pier and would allow the City to reclaim areas previously used for vehicles that could be repurposed with new pedestrian-oriented activities and uses.  Options for the Pier Bridge The EIR’s preferred two-bridge option presents two different approaches . The first is a circuitous looping ramping system.  The lengthy switchback ramping system requires many ramps and landings for a gradual ascent/decent for ADA compliance. The length of the ramping requires the final landing onto the Pier to occur past the Carousel building.  A second option , which the SMPC requests the City evaluate , substitutes the  ramping system in favor of an additional structure with an ADA - compliant slope followed by an elevator, escalators, and a staircase to fulfill accessibility requirements while also providing an enhanced pedestrian arrival experience that engages the Carousel.  It should be noted that the Pier Bridge Replacement Project is using federal transportation grant funds for highway bridges. The federal highway - bridge - replacement grant program is administrated by Caltrans on behalf of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). C altrans has determined that the proposed structure containing the elevator/escalator/stairs is not eligible for reimbursement due to reliability concerns in the event of mechanical issues or interruptions . However , Caltrans has indicated that a structural solution , such as a fixed ramping system , would be eligible for reimbursement. Caltrans has agreed to the inclusion of the alternative proposal in the EIR for further consideration, which provides the potential for the City to pursue the proposed non-eligible betterments with City funds. The EIR would also provide the opportunity for FWHA and Caltrans to reconsider whether mechanical systems could be considered reliable .  The City’s Disabilities Commission and Commission for the Senior Community Members supported non-mechanical means of accessibility due to the reliability concerns of elevators. Elevators and escalators located in a marine environment could present maintenance and reliability issues, as well as higher operating costs. At the conclusion of the EIR process, if the elevator/escalator refinement is endorsed by Council, additional capital and maintenance funding would be necessary.  Council is not being asked to take any action on the Pier Bridge Replacement Project tonight; however, the SMPC recommends that Council consider the elevator/escalator option.  The SMPC and staff seek Council comment on the SMPC Board Recommendations.  Specific actions and projects may ultimately require CEQA review. Twilight Concert Series (TCS) At its meeting on January 14, 2014 (Attachment s C and D ), Council discussed the growth in crowd size and public safety challenges associated with the TCS and reviewed modifications to the TCS framework to reposition it as a more community-focused event with minimal beach overflow. The modifications included the following changes: ·  Limit the crowd capacity on the Pier to approxima tely 4,000 as determined by the Office of the Fire Marshall ·  Focus programming on emerging talent, rather than performers with a regional or  national fan base ·  Rem ove the jumbotron and speakers on the beach ·  Revise the layout on the beach to increase public safety control and access  As a result of the reduction in crowd size on the Pier, and collaborative efforts between SMPC and the Police and Fire departments, the concert management on the Pier deck improved in 2016 and generally functioned smoothly under the established plan. H owever, most concert - goers flock to the beach, which has become a regional destination on Thursday evenings .  Crowd sizes have increased further since last year’s arrival of the Expo line. For 2016, p ublic safety staff estimated beach - crowd - size averages of between 15 ,000 and 20 ,000 people each week. The elimination of the jumbotron has not deterred attendance .  S ince most beach - goers are far from the speakers, which have remained, and many are unable to hear the music, staff assumes that many attendees are there mainly to enjoy an evening with friends on the beach. The efforts to book emerging talent have also not been effective at reducing attendance since bands that may be unknown when booked, may become popular by the time of the series .  In addition, for many attendees, the band does not matter as t hey are there for the festive, evening beach experience.  The designation of beach lanes and quadrants has helped with public safety; however, the large crowds on the beach continue to challenge public safety personnel and require the assistance of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department , as well as allied agencies , to fully staff each concert. Traffic within the entire downtown area is severely affected , to the point that last year, the Big Blue Bus was forced to re-route bus service along Fourth Street and to run a shuttle to transfer passengers. The beach is overwhelmed with trash and significant resources are required to clean up the beach after each concert, which defers regular summer beach maintenance. Although more portable restrooms were added in 2016, it is very difficult to provide a sufficient number to accommodate the large crowds. The portable restrooms need to be removed from the beach after each concert and set up the following week by Beach Maintenance staff .  The City has continued to receive complaints from neighbors regarding noise, trash, public intoxication , and urination associated with the beach crowds.   Proposed Changes for 2017 TCS Following a citywide review of the 2016 series last fall, a smaller group of City staff and SMPC Board members and staff have been meeting regularly since December 2016 to brainstorm ways to reduce public safety costs and minimize the impacts of the popular series on neighbors, the downtown and oceanfront communities, traffic, and the beach. As a result of the discussions, SMPC has agreed to implement the following recommendations for 2017: ·  Reduce the number of concerts from ten to eight ;  ·  Begin the series in mid-June rather than after July 4th to reduce the strain on  resources during the full - peak summer season ; ·  Market the TCS as a “green event” and develop communications to encourage  attendees to take alternative transportation ;  ·  Develop a traffic plan in collaboration with the City’s Transportation Division ;  ·  Develop a ride-sharing pick-up and drop-off lot for UBER and LYFT by the EXPO station to keep drivers out of the Ocean/Colorado area ;  ·  Expand the online RSVP system to better gauge crowed size for each concert; ·  Work with sponsors to develop beach clean-up campaigns, recruit trash ambassadors, and collaborate on solutions for increased restroom facilities ; and ·  Implement an extensive and on-going coordination framework between City s taff and Pier Corporation staff and their producers so that crowd sizes, based on talent, can be more accurately estimated.  The City’s costs for 2016 were approximately $1 million, primarily for public safety personnel. The SMPC has suggested increasing the number of private security personnel as a way to reduce Police staffing , as well as hiring a third party to audit the crowd size. Decisions on crowd size estimation and deployment are solely the purview of the Police and Fire Chiefs and their staff.  At its February 22, 2017 meeting , the SMPC board approved the expenditure of $200,000 from its budget to fund added private security, additional temporary restroom facilities, and beach clean-up. Th e new funds supplement the $200,000 Council authorized in 2014 for ongoing funding to the SMPC to support TCS. Staff will recommend an allocation of an additional $600,000 as part of the recommended FY  2017-2019 budget to cover City costs. Staff will return to Council in October or November 2017 to report on the effectiveness of the proposed changes and to seek Council direction regarding the future of the Twilight Concert Series.  The Study and the SMPC Board recommendations were unanimously approved by the Santa Monica Pier Board of Directors on December 17, 2015. Since the Board’s action, a Study Group of the Board and City staff have met on an ongoing basis to ensure coordination of the findings in the ROMA study and the resulting Board recommendations with both the LCP and Pier Bridge EIR presentations which are planned to be brought to Council later this year. 	\N	10

54	Use of a Framework for Performance Management and Data-Driven Decision Making	City Manager's Office, Administration	Santa Monica has a long reputation of being a progressive city , dedicated to providing a wide range of first-class services to our residents.  Since the 2015 creation of the Wellbeing Index, Santa Monica is also seen as a national leader in reshaping how we think about the purpose of local public services. It builds on our two decade commitment to setting citywide sustainability goals and the City’s widely-recognized pioneering innovations. Every one of our traditional services (policing, fire protection, street lighting, libraries etc.) originated in the challenges of particular times and places.  They have eventually become to be almost taken for granted as “what cities do.”  Now, in a changing world, our Wellbeing work re-focuses the public sector not on what we do, but why we do it – which in turn allows us to better guide decision-making for improving what we do.  This is particularly important in the context of efficient and effective use of public resources.  Santa Monica has thrived by providing an ever-expanding range of services.  We were the first in the nation to adopt a formal Sustainability Plan – which has spawned an ambitious and widely-admired work to reduce pollution, conserve resources and promote environmental health.  We secured foundation funding to create the Annenberg Community Beach House, a unique public amenity with a beachside pool, art gallery and multi-purpose public spaces along with a food concession and access to the shore for the disabled.  We are augmenting our partnership with the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, Santa Monica College and community non-profits to foster a successful “Cradle to Career” pathway for children raised in Santa Monica.  These and many, many more unique initiatives reflect a commitment to respond to community needs and desires.  What can be obscured in this growth of services is the ultimate purpose – and the basis for measuring the value and effectiveness of those services.  Government grows – but how can we measure the benefit to the community?  The Wellbeing Project gives Santa Monica a ground-breaking opportunity to do just that – to refocus our efforts not on expanding services but on producing better – and clearer --results.  We do that not by measuring what we do , but what outcomes we achieve .  The Wellbeing work illuminates some salient questions that can be overlooked if we take our service model for granted : ●  What are the most important dimensions of community and individual wellbeing? ●  How are people doing? ●  What are we trying to achieve and for whom? ●  How well are we succeeding ? ●  How can we both improve services and achieve better results ?  We want to know how residents and our community  are doing so we can shape public services and participate as partners in efforts that improve civic wellbeing. Funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies and aided by a team of experts, staff and community leaders  developed a pioneering methodology to measure  wellbeing, called the Wellbeing Index . It measures five areas of civic wellbeing called dimensions - community, place, learning, health, and economic opportunity .   Augmented by a sixth dimension, called outlook, measuring resident wellbeing on an individual level.  These dimensions will be adjusted to include other community values such as environmental sustainability and good governance .  These adaptations will be developed in partnership with RAND and other experts in order to assure fidelity to the best practices and current research.  Our goal is to establish a clear and consistent framework for what the City does based on the why of promoting civic wellbeing and sustainability for our residents and community.   Staff is working to create an organization-wide framework that would serve as the foundation for a new performance management system. An effective performance measurement and management system is based on knowing what you are seeking to achieve so you can measure your efforts to achieve it.  The Council has played a catalytic role in this effort by identifying the five Strategic Goals and supporting the development of the Wellbeing Index.  This year, we will  look at the work we are already doing in relation to the identified dimensions of Wellbeing and the goals of the Sustainable City Plan.  This effort to identify and align what we do with the outcomes we are trying to achieve will help shape the overall framework for performance management.  Based on that framework, we will identify key SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant & Timely) metrics and begin to collect and analyze data to determine how well we are meeting our goals, to give us ideas about how to be more effective at what we do, and inform decision-making.  Advancing organizational culture change and b uilding a comprehensive performance management system in Santa Monica will be an incremental process which will take a number of years. Evolving the City’s management system will be an iterative process; including a new, cohesive framework in the FY17-19 budget will be the first outwardly visible step.  As the policy makers for the City, the City Council is the driving force for identifying and clarifying the outcomes that matter most for civic wellbeing and sustainability.  The Council is charged with oversight on the performance of city government to achieve those outcomes.  Moreover, it is axiomatic that all successful organizational culture change is dependent on consistent leadership from the leaders of that organization. 	In June 2011, Council adopted Santa Monica’s first Biennial Budget, covering fiscal years 2011-13. Biennial budgets have been prepared for FY13-15, FY15-17, and are being developed for FY17-19 and will reflect the current five-year financial forecast, adopted plans and policies, and current areas of focus or emerging issues.  Also in 2011 the City instituted a new management system that used departmental goals, objectives, and service benchmarks to set targets and measure results. Work efforts were reported to the City Manager on a quarterly basis; department heads were held accountable for results. This approach facilitated detailed tracking and reporting of departmental achievements but did not connect work to broad organizational or community goals. The proposed framework would create and elevate broad organizational goals and create a baseline for future performance management strategies and metrics. 	  In 2013, Santa Monica was named 1 of just 5 winners (out of 305 entries nationwide) in Bloomberg Philanthropies first-ever Mayor’s Challenge - a competition designed to ignite innovation in local government. Santa Monica was chosen because we posed the idea that local government exists for a higher purpose than just providing specific services – that our ultimate goal is to help the people in our community thrive.   This ground-breaking approach grew out of our community’s work on a “ Youth Wellbeing Report Card ” that crossed traditional lines between the work of city government, schools, non-profits and community organizations, families and individual citizens.  It sought to measure and improve performance toward the wellbeing of young people.  Bloomberg saw the potential to apply this to the wellbeing of the whole community and all its residents.  The challenge to be solved starts with the reality that local government generally lacks critical data to measure our contribution and apply that data to systematically improve lives and our shared sense of community.    By applying leading edge practices to local governance , the City of Santa Monica proposed to create a new tool - the Local Wellbeing Index - that would help us genuinely understand trends, needs, and challenges faced by the people we serve. This concept of using data to understand people and drive change evolved over time thanks to lessons learned through our pioneering efforts to protect the environment, preserve affordable housing, address homelessness with compassion, and do whatever it takes to help our children succeed. Development of this new Wellbeing Index was guided by an international panel of experts to pare the emerging interdisciplinary research of wellbeing with the practicalities of local government.  The five dimensions of civic wellbeing defined below offer a foundation for a proposed framework. (Please see Attachment A: Wellbeing Framework) ●  Community: Often described as “social capital,” a community with strong connections among its inhabitants can flourish in good times and withstand the tough ones. How strong is the sense of community and connection in Santa Monica? ●  Place: The characteristics of the area in which people live—physical, social, environmental and economic—affect how wellbeing is fostered and supported. Does Santa Monica’s physical and social environment promote/support wellbeing? ●  Learning: Education is linked to virtually all wellbeing outcomes, but even beyond measures of high school or college graduations, lifelong learning in and out of the classroom is a key factor of wellbeing. Do people have the opportunity to enrich their knowledge across the lifespan? ●  Health: Being and feeling healthy—or at least having the tools and resources needed to manage any health challenges—are essential to an overall sense of wellbeing. How healthy is Santa Monica? ●  Economic Opportunity: Economic conditions, including opportunities for upward mobility, are key to creating a community in which a diverse population can live and thrive. Is Santa Monica a place in which a diverse population can live and thrive?  Staff have begun inventorying core municipal services throughout the organization and mapping work efforts to a primary dimension. This work, which will continue over the next few months, will also fully integrate with environmental sustainability and good governance. This staff work has already produced new insights and perspectives into how the work of different departments and divisions does – and does not – align together in ways that transcends traditional lines on departmental organization charts. The City has a long history of promoting local quality of life by providing a comprehensive range of City services (“full service city.”) The City has also in recent decades championed visionary values of social equity, environmental sustainability and enhancing the wellbeing of the community for the sake of current and future generations. Yet the City of Santa Monica does not have a Council-adopted overall vision or mission statement, nor a strategic plan .  (It does have a motto that presages the concept of civic wellbeing: Populus felix in urbe felice , loosely translated as “Happy people in a happy city.”).  In 1994 Council adopted Santa Monica’s first Sustainable City Plan which identified organizational and community-wide sustainability goals for the environment, local economy and community quality of life, and established metrics to track progress toward meeting those goals.  In 2003 that plan was significantly expanded following a 15 month community process that resulted in the current plan that includes nine goal areas focusing on Resource Conservation, Environmental and Public Health, Economic Development, Housing, Open Space and Land Use, Transportation, Community Education and Civic Participation, Human Dignity, and Arts and Culture.  Last summer, Council assessed a dozen major initiatives then underway and chose five Strat egic Goals. Those top priorities ( none of which were new efforts although each involved a refocusing on tangible long-term outcomes ) , are listed below. Each has been mapped t o a primary wellbeing dimension: ●  Maintaining an inclusive and diverse community ●  Establishing a new model for mobility ●  Securing local control of the City land occupied by the Santa Monica Airport ●  Taking a leadership role in regional efforts to address homelessness ●  Fostering a community partnership to Learn + Thrive   As a full-service city, City departments provide police, fire, trans portation ( including a regional bus system and general aviation airport), water, wastewater, refuse, streets, parking, planning, building, engineering, free public Wi-Fi, a high speed fiber optic network, parks, affordable housing, economic development, sustainability, library, rent control, recreational, social, cultural, and educational services to the community.  Most of the City’s core operations also align to one or more dimensions of the proposed framework, thus reinforcing that Santa Monica’s priorities and municipal services further community, place, learning, health, economic opportunity, sustainability, and good governance goals and outcomes. While Santa Monica’s foundation of wellbeing and sustainability is unique, cities often cite economic health, environmental health, accessibility, safety, and livability as key outcomes.  An interdepartmental team comprised of representatives from the Finance Department, Office of Civic Wellbeing, Department of Public Works, and City Manager’s Office plus the leads of the five Strategic Goals, who were the first employees to map and align work efforts within the framework, are leading the development of the framework and evolution of the City’s performance management system. On January 10, the City’s Leadership Team of Department Heads and Division Managers, plus Budget Analysts, convened to learn about t he Wellbeing Index, its dimensions, and how the framework will be incorporated into the Biennial Budget. About a week later, on January 18, the same group of staff re-convened to learn how other cities have used organizational frameworks as the foundation of their performance management systems and began to map key daily municipal services and operations within the proposed framework. (Please see Attachment B: Workshop Photos) Over the next few months, staff will continue to map their operations. As the framework is meant to be a comprehensive and living tool, able to capture the City’s dynamic work, changes and additions will be made throughout the budget cycle.   How well are we succeeding ? How can we both improve services and achieve better results?  It’s important to know what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, how well it should be done, get regular feedback about results, and work collectively to improve. More simply, that means asking and answering the questions “What are we trying to do?”, “How well are we doing it?”, and “How can we be more effective ?” That’s performance management.  We are certainly not alone in focusing on measuring and managing performance.  It is nearly universal in the private sector. Student achievement testing has exerted a profound impact on public education and foundations and funders are increasingly insisting non-profits measure and manage their outcomes.  Cities across the country have developed innovative and iterative models to measure and manage performance .  The CompStat model that originated in police agencies in Boston, New York and Los Angeles has had wide influence in law enforcement. CityStat in Baltimore applied performance measurement and management to a wider range of municipal services and has also been widely embraced by innovative city governments. There are now sophisticated data visualization por tals to capture and convey goals and outcomes. Baltimore , Boston , Louisville  and Los Angeles  each have municipal performance management programs and associated , including web sites that serve as “dashboards” or “scoreboards” to publicly report results .  Locally, Santa Monica’s Sustainable City Plan and Sustainable City Report Card have been used as models by numerous cities throughout the U.S. as they developed and implemented similar performance management systems.    Since 2012, Santa Monica’s Cradle to Career Initiative has established cross departmental and interagency projects to improve outcomes for kindergarten readiness and teen mental health.  Since 2014, over 35 cities have requested guidance on how to implement a local government wellbeing framework to guide performance management and outcome-oriented governance.  Towards that end, Santa Monica has been asked by Bloomberg Philanthropies to co-sponsor a convening of twelve pilot cities across the United States to begin replication of the wellbeing framework and index work.  The process of measuring and managing performance starts with defining clear, meaningful and measurable objectives and targets about what we want to achieve.  For example, progress towards an affordable and diverse community may be gauged through increasing the number of deed-restricted affordable housing in Santa Monica. One way to tell how well the community is thriving may be the number of Santa Monica residents who feel that they can count on their neighbors. These are metrics for some of our Strategic Goals. We will also create meaningful and measurable goals and metrics for day-to-day City operations.  Once the goals are set, data will be captured, analyzed and shared. By looking at data, we can see if we are making progress towards our intended outcomes or figure out a new approach. We’ll make decisions or recommendations based on what we’ve learned. And, being clear about what we want to achieve as well as our actual achievements helps everyone know how they contribute. Plus, we can show our results to the community and celebrate successes.  It should be emphasized that while we are being more systematic and comprehensive in this effort, we are certainly not starting from scratch.  Our Police Department uses performance management to track, solve and prevent crime.  Our Big Blue Bus uses “key performance indicators” (a widely used term in the private sector) to manage on-time performance and other results.  Every department uses data and metrics in day-to-day management.  What we are building, however, is a citywide culture and comprehensive approach to measure what matters most and make it transparent to the community.  That is the future of local public sector accountability.  The next steps in the evolution of our performance management practices include creating a coherent path forward, working with departments on mapping operations to existing and proposed dimensions, defining key terms, finding examples from other cities as well as from within the organization, identifying “early adopters” or pilots, building staff teams, and securing the resources needed to successfully implement a performance management system. The City’s new Chief Performance Officer, who will soon be joined by the City’s first Chief Data Officer, the Office of Civic Wellbeing, and the Finance Department will spearhead this.  How does what we do influence civic wellbeing and sustainability ? Cities must leverage all of the data they routinely collect about residents, services, and programs in order to establish policy recommendations, develop programs, and gauge their impact. Every City plan or policy is informed by stakeholder input, which may come through formal and informal planning processes, surveys and data collection, stakeholder meetings, Boards, Commissions, and Task Forces, neighborhood associations, comments to the Council, social media, and other avenues.  While Santa Monica already uses a diversity of data sources to understand community needs and the efficacy of programs and services, creating a framework and evolving our performance management system creates an opportunity to collect and use data in a more focused manner. Future feedback and data points will be viewed and evaluated within the context of the City’s framework.   This organizational evolution starts by developing a cohesive framework that is meaningful to community, Council, and staff. With a framework in place, we can align programs and services to specific dimensions and demonstrate how Council priorities and municipal operations further organizational goals. Staff has already begun mapping work to the wellbeing dimensions and creating metrics, first with the S trategic G oals. For example, investing in a new homeless multidisciplinary street team that can provide field-based medical, mental health, substance abuse, and housing placement services to a specific group of 25 historically high-users of emergency services is a pro-active way to address how homelessness impacts the quality and access of shared and community spaces, or place. We will use data from multiple sources to assess if this intervention reduces the number of arrests, citations, field interviews, and use of emergency medical services by the cohort as well as the cost-effectiveness of the model.  The FY 2017-19 budget will begin to transition the way the City communicates about its programs and services. To do this, there will be some changes in the budget book.  ·  City Manager’s Message : will introduce the civic wellbeing framework and discuss the larger context of ongoing citywide change projects. ·  Framework Section (new): will provide an in-depth introduction to the framework, defining the wellbeing dimensions, connections to strategic goals, and application to citywide work. ·  Departmental Summaries : will include department projects and operations that support the civic wellbeing dimensions and sustainability . This will replace the goals, objectives, and benchmarks in the current department summary section.  The Framework Section will also function as a standalone document that we’ll update throughout the year as we refine project and program alignment to dimensions and develop metrics. This will be our first step in establishing a performance management system through which we’ll better be able to evaluate whether we are meeting the community’s needs.  The projects shown in Departmental summaries will highlight the City’s ongoing, core functions – like the provision of water, plan check review, fleet management – and link them to the framework outcomes of improving wellbeing in Santa Monica.  Structuring a budget around the achievement of large- scale policy outcomes is occurring in communities across the United States.  Outcome-based budgeting, or performance-based budgeting, aligns budgetary decisions with the achievement of large-scale outcomes.  In recent years, cities such as Richmond, VA, Baltimore, MD, and Lincoln, NE have adopted outcome-based budgeting strategies, as well as over 45% of state governments.  This approach focuses on the use of long-range budgeting to ensure that budget priorities and requests connect with the achievement of policy outcomes.  Developing a framework will allow the Santa Monica to develop a budget that includes detailed metrics which will showcase the work of departments in achieving major outcomes for the residents of the city.  Like all sustainable changes in organizational culture, b uilding a comprehensive performance management system in Santa Monica will be an incremental process which will take a number of years. Nor does it operate in isolation from complimentary efforts to align budget with performance (“performance budgeting”); greater investment in training and workforce skill development; pursuing data-driven decision-making; and investing in the technology and workspaces that support these efforts.  Creating and using a framework will help City staff see how their work advances a citywide strategy and know what is expected of them.  And, the overall effort of aligning and evaluating our efforts will help staff manage to consistent priorities, offer more effective public services, improve community and organizational outcomes, and produce more meaningful and integrated communication about the City’s work.  	\N	11

56	Award Contract Energy Efficiency Package Bid (Parks, Lots, Structures)	Public Works, Street & Fleet Services	In support of Council’s commitment to public safety, environmental sustainability, and fiscal responsibility, the City has undertaken replacing streetlights with more efficient Light Emitting Diode ( LED ) lights. The cost of replacing these lights is subsidized by on-b i ll financing through Southern California Edison (SCE) . Staff now seek s approval to implement additional energy efficiency measures in four parks, six parking structures, and seven parking lots in an amount not to exceed $1, 20 8 , 6 39 . The majority of the project would involve retrofitting inefficient lights to LED and would be paid through savings on electricity bills . Staff estimate s that the City would see a return on investment in under nine years. 	Energy efficiency in municipal operations is a key component of the City’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and save on utility costs. Since 2006, the City has successfully saved over 4.3 million kWh annually through energy efficiency. An additional 750,000 kWh in savings are anticipated through the recent conversion of streetlights to LED.  These conversions are a direct measure in the 15x15 Climate Action Plan adopted by City Council in February 2013 (Attachment A) and are supportive of Council’s ongoing priorities of enhancing public safety, protecting the environment, and maintaining fiscal responsibility . Replacement of existing high-pressure sodium lighting fixtures with LED lighting would provide an energy-efficient system that would reduce the energy consumption in the converted areas and also reduce maintenance costs. 	Th e  energy efficiency project package was approved as a part of the FY  201 7 -18 Capital Improvement Budget and would focus on the replacement of existing lighting within City parks, parking structures, and parking lots with LED lighting with supplemental funding from SCE through rebates and on-bill financing . This package would also include non-reimbursable measures to replace light poles at Beach Lot 1 at 1550 PCH, new fixtures at Reed Park, and install a new carbon monoxide (CO) detection system and variable speed drives to control five garage exhaust fans in Parking Structure 9. The system would monitor CO levels and operate the fans at the minimum speed required to maintain acceptable CO concentrations.  While not all measures are covered by SCE’s rebate and on-bill financing programs, replacing or upgrading the systems is still recommended by staff. By bundling various measures, staff can accelerate energy savings, increase project implementation efficiency and reduce administration costs. Collectively, the projects would save over 1.1 million kWh. A map of all project locations is included in Attachment B.  In May 201 7 , the City submitted 12 applications to fund this conversion project under the SCE’s On-bill Financing (OBF) and Energy Rebate Program. This program offers reimbursements for eligible expenses incurred to complete the lighting upgrades. Rebates are issued directly and the OBF, which is a 0% interest loan, is repaid over time through a charge on the City’s monthly utility bill. Approval on all 12 submitted applications is expected to be received in summer 2017.  Staff recommends entering into an OBF agreement with S CE in an estimated amount of $ 785 , 802 in FY 201 7 -1 8 to fund the eligible energy efficiency measures .  When the proposed conversion project is completed, SCE would conduct a final inspection and issue a rebate check and OBF loan proceeds check which, together, would reimburse the City for the cost of construction with the exception of $ 71,200 . SCE would then add a monthly loan repayment charge to the utility accounts impacted. The monthly payment is calculated to be equal to the energy cost savings generated by the project , allowing the City to continue paying the same amount to SCE with no budget changes needed. Once the loan is repaid, the energy cost savings would revert to the General Fund. The monthly loan payments would be made on the electric bill of the facility receiving the efficiency upgrade over an average of 8 to 9 years for all  of the project s .

LEDs reduce maintenance costs and yield significant energy cost savings.  Public Outreach and Project Timeline The Street and Fleet Services Division of the Public Works Department would manage the construction and collaborate with the Office of Sustainability & the Environment to implement communications and outreach. Construction is anticipated to start  in October 2017 with an expected duration of six months. Community notices would be issued via the website, flyers at facilities and social media. On March 8, 2017, the City published Notices Inviting Bids to convert 4 , 152 outdoor LED ligh ts across 12 facilities in accordance with City specifications. The bid was posted on the City’s on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press , in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. 722 vendors were notified, 92 vendors downloaded the bid. Five bids were received and publicly opened on March 24, 2017.  Bidder Bid Amount tL Custom Lighting $ 342 , 629 Green Energy Innovations $ 711 ,924 Siemens Industry, Inc. $ 1 , 050 , 990 Aegis ITS $ 2 , 325 ,994 Comet Electric, Inc. $ 2 , 648 , 909  The bid s w ere evaluated based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, previous experience, capacity and skill, ability to deliver, quality of product, and compliance with City specifications and scope of work. Siemens Industry Inc. is not the lowest bidder, but offered in most cases, installation of new fixtures with manufacturer warranties, in addition to a one-year warranty on installation; responded to City supplemental bid questions regarding DarkLights Consortium (DLC) lighting compliance and their ability to provide documentation needed for on-bill financing submittals; and provided references which indicated that the company has satisfactorily completed projects of similar size and scope. Based on these criteria, Siemens Industry Inc . , is recommended as the best bidder. 	\N	12

58	City Services Building Guaranteed Maximum Price for Construction Services and Award for Construction Management Services	Public Works, Architecture Services	The City Services Building (CSB) Project brings nearly all core municipal operations onto one City Hall campus as envisioned in the Civic Center Specific Plan. The investment in this new building meets three main objectives:  Offers a one-stop hub to better serve the community. The CSB would bring departments and vital public counter functions under one roof to streamline services in one location.  Eliminates all existing city office space leases and consolidates municipal operations onto city-owned land. City Hall was constructed in 1938 and in 79 years, the services that the City provides to the community has expanded and outgrown the historic building. For several decades, city divisions have been spread throughout the downtown, leasing space. With the construction of the City Services Building, the City will eliminate leases saving as much as $10 million annually and bring 240 staff under one roof.  Achieves a strong return on investment for the City both economically and environmentally with a resource efficient structure. The building is a long term investment that is designed to streamline operational functionality and to be resource efficient. It is a Living Building and will not have a water or electric bill because it will produce the energy and water it consumes on site.  The total cost of the City Services Building Project is anticipated to be $76,760,000. Staff proposes to fund the City Services Building Project using $76,760,000 million in bond proceeds as proposed in Item 9A of tonight’s Council Meeting agenda. The detailed breakdown of costs related to the CSB is explained in Table 1 of this report. The GMP Amendment 2 to Design-Build Contract No. 10051 (CCS) for construction services with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company would be the final of a three phased design-build approach for the City Services Building Project:  Phase I:   Feasibility analysis, concept design and cost estimates Phase II:  Design services including schematic design, design development, construction documents, project management, and cost estimating Phase III:  Construction services including construction administration  Staff recommends executing the GMP Amendment 2 for City Services Building construction with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company in the amount of $61,843,526 (includes 2.4% contingency) for a total contract amount not to exceed $70,600,507. The total contract amount includes $1,310,750 for previously authorized design services and $600,000 in newly requested construction services for City Hall improvements. In addition, staff recommends GKK Works to provide construction management services for the City Services Building Project in an amount not to exceed $887,920 (includes 10% contingency). 	On March 27, 2012 (Attachment A), Council authorized staff to seek proposals for the feasibility, initial design and cost estimates for a City Services Building located on the selected site east of City Hall.  On October 8, 2013 (Attachment B), staff issued an Information Item detailing the proposed design-build delivery method for the design and construction of the City Services Building. This approach offered phased implementation, starting with a feasibility analysis, concept design and cost estimation, and an integrated project team of builders, designers and specialty consultants to provide expertise throughout the entire project delivery timeline.  On April 8, 2014 (Attachment C), Council authorized the City Manager to negotiate and execute a professional services agreement with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company for the feasibility analysis, concept design and cost estimates for the City Services Building Project. This agreement was the first of three phases in the design-build process.  On January 27, 2015 (Attachment D), Council reviewed a feasibility report on the City Services Building Project and authorized the City Manager to negotiate a Guaranteed Maximum Price with design-build contractor Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company for design services including Living Building Challenge certification.  On April 28, 2015 (Attachment E), Council authorized the City Manager to execute a contract with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company for design services for the City Services Building Project in an amount not to exceed $7,064,501. This agreement was the second of three phases in the design-build process.  On May 24, 2016 (Attachment F), Council reviewed and commented on the schematic design and cost estimates for the City Services Building, and directed staff to proceed with design development.  On November 1, 2016 (Attachment G), Council authorized the City Manager to negotiate and execute a first contract modification to Agreement #10051 (CCS) with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company to incorporate additional design services in an amended Guaranteed Maximum Price for design with a new total amount not to exceed $8,756,981. S taff expanded design services to include adjustments to the City Services Building program, provide technical design services to move the City’s Traffic Management Center to the building, modify the courtyard circulation, design additional environmental systems for the pasteurization of waste materials produced in the building and to provide an additional CEQA historic resources technical report for the project. Additionally, staff increased the design-build scope of work to include a tenant improvement project in the South Wing of City Hall to be done after completion of the City Services Building construction, and to design the essential fire and life safety alterations in City Hall as required by code officials.  On January 24, 2017 (Attachment H), Council reviewed the Civic Center Specific Plan EIR Sixth Addendum with the Final EIR and adopted a resolution to amend the Civic Center Specific Plan to account for the relocation of the City Services Building to the rear of the Santa Monica City Hall. 	 Santa Monica’s City Hall was originally constructed in 1939 and the building serves as an outstanding example of the Moderne style of architecture, popular throughout Los Angeles in the 1930s. City Hall is listed in the California Register of Historic Resources and as a Santa Monica Historic Landmark. City Hall was built during a time when the city’s population was roughly half its current size and virtually the entire City workforce was housed in one building.  The City’s population and scope of local municipal services have expanded significantly in the intervening three-quarters of a century. Since adoption in 2005 of an updated Civic Center Specific Plan, it has been a planned vision to create a more cohesive Civic Campus that better serves the public and centralizes staff. A City Services Building has long been planned to be constructed immediately adjacent to City Hall. The new building would be approximately 50,000 square feet, including three stories plus a basement and 45 feet above grade.  The City Services Building Project (CSB) would result in substantial future savings by eliminating numerous leased office spaces for approximately 240 City staff and would realize the vision for a centralized Civic Campus. The CSB would bring departments and vital public counter functions under one roof to streamline services into a one-stop location. By creating a consolidated workplace, staff’s ability to collaborate would improve along with staff’s increased efficiency and productivity to serve the community. Today municipal operations are spread throughout Santa Monica, but in the future there would be only two hubs of operation: the City Hall Civic Campus and City Yards.  The proposed building’s design is subtle and intended to accent City Hall’s eastern edge in a quiet emerging manner that will reflect and respect City Hall. Approvals by the Planning Commission and the Landmarks Commission have been received for the project.  The new building’s ground floor was thoughtfully designed to achieve an improved public experience. The design incorporates advanced acoustics and thermal comfort for the health and wellbeing of its visitors and occupants.  City services consolidated in the space to serve the public in one location include finance, utilities, parking, plan check, permits and civil land development. The CSB design would also address critical utilities upgrades and routing that feed City Hall, the Public Safety Facility and the new building. The CSB would serve as an essential services building, which means it would be fully operational during emergencies and disasters.  The City anticipates using annual lease savings to offset the cost of the lease revenue bonds that would be issued to pay for the CSB.  Annual lease savings would meet and exceed the annual costs of debt service during the 30-year financing term. The CSB is designed to meet Living Building Challenge certification and would be a net zero energy and net zero water building. The design would address the realities of climate change and drought, and its success would demonstrate to the region and the world what is possible by regenerative building design and construction.  The CSB would fulfill multifaceted community goals and CCSP goals by: ·  Being designed sensitively in context to the historic and landmarked City Hall, and accomplishing improvements to the Civic Core as intended by the Civic Center Specific Plan ·  Integrating more public counter services into the City Hall location and improving the overall customer and community experience ·  Advancing the Council’s sustainability commitment as worldwide environmental leaders by providing a model of sustainable design and construction ·  Providing taxpayer savings over its 100-year useful lifespan by eliminating expensive office space lease agreements, incurring zero utility fees which result in long-term net savings, and providing a net positive environmental benefit by harvesting its own energy and water onsite  The bond amount of $76,760,000 million, which is also before the Council for approval, would be used to fund the CSB. The detailed breakdown of costs related is explained below in Table 1.  The updated cost of the City Services Building has been revised from previous estimates to include $760,000 for the City-mandated allocation to the Percent for Art program, and $1,195,251 in additional contingency reflecting available bond proceeds.

Alternatives Members of the community have suggested that, as an alternative to constructing the City Services Building behind City Hall, the City consider purchasing the historic Post Office Building at 1248 Fifth Street and build it out to accommodate City staff currently occupying leased office space.  Based on the City’s preliminary evaluation, this option is not feasible. Below is a comparison of the two projects:   Current floor area 33,000 sq. ft. N/A Entitled build out size: 48,458 sq. ft. 50,200 sq. ft. Total occupants at build out: 54 240  The Post Office Building is a registered historic landmark with requirements that limit how it may be developed. It includes the main floor and a basement level that total approximately 33,000 square feet. The main lobby of the building, which is approximately 3,500 sq. ft., is a historically significant component of the building that cannot be significantly altered, limiting the amount of usable current floor area to under 30,000 sq. ft. The current entitlements would allow for an additional 15,000 sq. ft. bringing the total usable floor area to approximately 45,000 sq. ft. at build out. In order to design usable office space in the basement level, significant modifications would need to be made to allow access to natural light, which would likely further limit the available floor area of the building. As currently permitted, the building is designed to house 54 people and would have 25 onsite parking spaces upon completion. The cost for the City to purchase the Post Office Building is currently unknown. The building was purchased for $25 million in 2013.  With the current entitlements and increases in property value over the past 4 years, it is estimated that the purchase price would exceed $30 million today.  The planned City Services Building adjacent to City Hall is a 50,200 sq. ft. building that would house City staff who currently occupy leased space in several buildings in various locations in Santa Monica. In total, the new building would accommodate 240 City staff. The project is intended to centralize City functions in one location to significantly improve convenience, efficiency and customer service. The building would be funded using lease revenue bonds, which would be paid using the funds currently allocated to pay for leased office space. However, the amount of funding available would be based on the number of employees that could be relocated from current leased space to the new location. Additionally, the funds invested to date of close to $10M would be lost and would also need to be considered in the total costs of an alternative project.  It is very unlikely that the Post Office Building could accommodate 240 City staff at full build out, due to the smaller total usable floor space. There are significant restrictions on modifications made to buildings with landmark status that would generate significant challenges. Even under the best of circumstances, the separated lobby and the basement condition at the Post Office Building would make it difficult to create conditions that would accommodate all of the relocated City staff. The existing permitted plans allow for just 54 occupants. In order to increase that number to allow for even 100 occupants the entire space would need to be redesigned and new permits would need to be obtained, which would add to the cost of the project. In comparison, the CSB design can accommodate 240 staff because it is an open plan design with natural light and ventilation and would be built to maximize the efficient use of space.  The cost to complete a full redesign and construction of the Post Office Building has not been evaluated because the constraints on the site and the City’s ability to fund its purchase and construction, as noted above, make it clear that it is not a feasible option to replace the City Services Building project. To summarize, not all City staff currently in leased office space could be adequately housed in the Post Office Building, requiring the City to continue leasing space for some functions. It would not centralize currently disparate City functions in one location because some of those functions would have to remain at City Hall and others in leased space. The small amount of parking on the site after build out would require City staff to park in other locations in the downtown, impacting the parking supply in the area. This represents an expensive option that would maintain the current status quo with regard to location of City staff and inefficient service delivery to the public. As such, it would not provide benefits to the community through a central Civic Campus improving customer service, operational efficiency and cost savings that would be achieved by proceeding with the City Services Building project as currently proposed.  Consultant Selection - Construction Management On June 2, 2017, the City issued a Request for Proposals RFP #SP2250 to provide construction management services for the City Services Building Project. The RFP was posted on the City’s online bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with the City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. A total of 50 vendors downloaded the RFP. The City received and publicly opened seven proposals on June 14, 2017. Responses to the RFP were reviewed by a selection panel of staff from the Public Works Department.  List of proposals received: ·  Cumming ·  Griffin Structures ·  PMCS Group, Inc. ·  Arcadis ·  GKK Works ·  Vanir ·  Civil Source  Evaluation was based on the following selection criteria: technical competence, staffing capability, project approach and planning, past performance, dispute resolution, quality control, cost control, customer service, and the cost of services . Based on this criteria and criteria in SMMC 2.24.073, staff recommends GKK Works as the best qualified firm to provide construction management services for the City Services Building Project. The GKK Works team has extensive knowledge and experience on numerous design-build construction projects involving new municipal building construction. They have also successfully managed projects that included essential services buildings, net zero energy programs, and complex water systems requiring close coordination with the Regional Water Quality Control Board and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.  Next Steps Upon Council approval of the GMP for construction and issuance of the lease-revenue bonds, staff anticipates the following project timeline: ·  Site preparation and utility relocation work - September 2017 ·  Start of full construction work - January 2018 ·  Complete construction - April 2020  	\N	12
60	Resolution for California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecyle) Grants	Public Works, Office of Sustainability & Environment	The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) administers the Food Waste Prevention and Rescue Grant Program. The aim of the program is to lower overall greenhouse gas emissions by creating new or expanding  existing food waste prevention projects to reduce the amount of food sent to the landfills . This is the first CalRecycle grant of its kind. The City of Santa Monica is eligible for this funding and has benefited in the past from CalRecycle programs . The City intends to apply for a $100 ,000  grant to build a stronger food recovery program .  The City plans to seek Food Waste Prevention and Rescue grants from CalRecycle to work toward Santa Monica’s council adopted Zero Waste and Carbon Neutrality goals by diverting organics from the landfill. While Santa Monica has a citywide organics collection program, food and food-soiled paper continue to be the largest component s of the city’s waste stream. The grant funding would facilitate collaboration between local businesses, non-profits, residents, and the City to decrease landfilled organics (food, food-soiled paper) by developing a food recovery and a donation program. The resolution would authorize the City to apply for these funds for fiscal years 2017-2018 through 2022-2023. 	City Council previously adopted resolution number 10657 (CCS) on February 14, 2012 authorizing the City Manager to execute various grant program applications under the CalRecycle program for all grants the City of Santa Monica is eligible for . Resolution 10657 (CCS) expired on June 30 , 2017. To date the City has received approximately $900,000 in grant funding from CalRecycle to support various programs ranging from Used Oil and Filter Recycling to Tire Recycling programs. 	  According to the CalRecycle Business Group Waste Stream characterization calculator, 26,543 tons of food was disposed of in Santa Monica  in 2014 . Currently, only 10-18 percent of surplus edible food in the United States is recovered and distributed. This c ould be significantly improved through food waste prevention and donation .  The City would use the grant funds to host a f ood f orum that would bring together stakeholders from restaurants, businesses, and non-profits around Santa Monica to discuss food waste prevention and donation s . While a vast network of food rescue organizations and businesses exist in the Los Angeles region, a food forum has not taken place in Santa Monica to bring together local stakeholders. The forum would raise awareness by educating local constituents and help to develop a stronger and better coordinated network. Once participating businesses have been identified , pre-waste audits w ould begin to benchmark the percentage of edible vs. non-edible food waste generated by these businesses. After the preliminary audit, businesses w ould receive necessary donation materials such as storage and pickup containers and , potentially , refrigerators depending on the volume and type of food donated. The City w ould contract with local food donation and collection non-profits and utilize a n existing mobile application to make food donation and collection more convenient and on demand. The f ood collected w ould be donated to populations in need throughout the City. The remaining non-edible food waste , including food-soiled paper, w ould be diverted from the landfill through composting programs.  Similar to the City Council resolution number 10657 (CCS) adopted on February 14, 2012 , which authorized the City Manager to execute various grant program applications under the CalRecycle program, s taff would use this resolution as authority to apply for Food Waste Prevention and Rescue grants from CalRecycle over the next five years. 	\N	12

63	Construction Contract for Santa Monica Utility Undergrounding and Excavation	Information Systems Department, Broadband	S anta Monica’s broadban d initiative, Santa Monica City Net, delivers network services, and data communications to the City’s technology, entertainment, and healthcare businesses, and to affordable housing residents participating in the City’s Digital Inclusion Pilot program.  In September 2015, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) published approved federal grant funding sources, including Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, for broadband infrastructure deployment.  As a part of the City’s Digital Inclusion Pilot, the City appropriated FY 2016-17 and proposed using FY 2017-18 CDBG funds for the utility undergrounding construction phase of a project that would expand CityNet’s Gigabit Broadband offering to an additional 500 families living in 29 multi-dwelling affordable housing buildings, to further digital inclusion program goals.  This phase of the expansion project consists of utility undergrounding, conduit installation, fiber optic cable installation, and construction services for the City’s fiber optic network in the Public Right-of-Way.  The utility undergrounding would add approximately 11,319 linear feet of fiber optic infrastructure, expanding the City’s network to the building parcels of 29 affordable housing buildings.  Staff conducted a competitive bidding process in February 2017 to select a contractor.  One bid, from High Light Electric, was received as a result of this process.  At this time, staff recommends executing a contract with High Light Electric, Inc. to provide utility undergrounding, conduit installation, fiber optic cable installation, and construction services for the City’s fiber optic network, at a total cost not to exceed $1,850,000 over a two-year period, including contingency . 	T he City of Santa Monica has built a Municipal Fiber Optic Network, CityNet, for delivering voice, video, and data communications to City businesses, and to affordable housing residents participating in the City’s Digital Inclusion Pilot.  The Digital Inclusion Pilot is a project supporting City Council’s Strategic Goals to provide community-wide Gigabit speed fiber and maintaining an inclusive and diverse community, as established on August 23, 2015 (Attachment A).  Construction for the original 10 affordable housing buildings is complete, offering 425 families with an affordable Gigabit Broadband option.  In addition, the Community Room within each building is delivered free 10 Gigabit Broadband for community engagement and afterschool programs serving over 100 Santa Monica K-12 students.  Staff is currently obtaining feedback on the onboarding, online payment processing, and customer training from the initial pilot beta customers.  Seizing an opportunity to expand the pilot with federal grant funds, in an effort to deliver a Gigabit broadband offering to an additional 500 families, would provide a more comprehensive pilot covering a total of 39 multi-dwelling building types, and operational testing more representative of the assortment of residential building infrastructure conditions within the city.  City staff has participated in broadband advocacy on a national level with several key federal agencies during the Obama Administration, including the Government Accountability Office, NTIA, FCC, and the White House Office of Science & Tech Policy.  In September 2015, NTIA collaborated with US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and a number of federal agencies to formalize and publish approved federally funded grant sources for broadband infrastructure (Attachment E ). HUD’s CDBG grant funding was identified as an approved grant funding source, and as part of the FY 2016-17 and Proposed FY 2017-18 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) budget development, City staff leveraged available CDBG grant funding to build the infrastructure for the City’s Digital Inclusion Pilot expansion.  In October 2016, the City issued a Request for Bids for a defined phase of Utility Undergrounding and Excavation work for an expansion of the fiber network for the Digital Inclusion Pilot. The bid required interpretation of bid engineering drawings and an active General “A” and Class C-10 Electrical Contractor license at the time of bid submission in order to submit a bid on the project.  The bid (Bid#UUC1005), was publicly opened on December 29, 2016, resulting in one bid submitted.  The one bid that was submitted was incomplete and therefore, staff recommended and Council approved rejecting all incomplete bids on May 9, 2017 (Attachment C).  A revised Notice of Inviting Bids for Utility Undergrounding and Excavation Work was published in February 2017 . 	 T he City issued a Request for Bids for utility construction required for the CDBG funded project to extend the City’ fiber optic network.  The project would construct a phase of utility undergrounding to add 11,319 linear feet of infrastructure to the City’s fiber optic network. The project comprises approximately 11,319 linear feet of directional boring and conduit installation, installation of approximately 15,919 linear feet of fiber optic cable, and excavation and installation of eighty-four (84) 24”x 36”x 24” pull boxes, along with related restoration work and traffic control management.  Only one bid was received from High Light Electric as part of the bidding process.  At this time, staff recommends executing a contract with High Light Electric, Inc. to provide utility undergrounding, conduit installation, fiber optic cable installation, and construction services for a total contract not to exceed $1,850,000, including contingency.  Public Outreach Public Outreach for this project would be provided by Information Systems Department staff, consisting of public notifications to adjacent property owners, tenants, and surrounding community on the project scope, potential impacts, and schedule. Staff would provide updates and contact information to inquiries during construction .  Vendor/Consultant Selection On February 2, 2017, the City published Notices Inviting Bids to provide utility undergrounding, excavation, and construction services as required by the Information Systems Department in accordance with City specifications.  The bid was posted on the City’s online bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal code provisions.  1,399 vendors were notified, 47 vendors downloaded the bid, and 8 vendors attended the mandatory pre-bid job walk.  One (1) bid was received by the City Clerk’s Office and publicly opened on March 27, 2017.  Staff from the City Clerk’s Office and the Information Systems Department attended the public bid opening.  The sole bidder, High Light Electric, completed the mandatory pre-bid job walk and submitted all necessary bid documents.  Staff conducted additional outreach to vendors who downloaded the bid and attended the mandatory pre-bid job walk, to inquire as to why the vendors did not submit bids.  The vendors ’ responses varied; including general conflicts with current workload, project schedule and/or project duration conflicts with larger projects, concerns with prevailing wage compliance for a federally funded project, and one vendor had an active “A” general contractor license, but did not have the Class C-10 Electrical Contractor’s license required to bid on the project.   A selection committee of Information Systems Department staff reviewed the bid. The bid was evaluated based upon the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, ability, capacity, and skill of the bidder to perform services, capacity of the bidder to perform the service promptly, within the time specified, without delay or interference, and compliance with City specifications and scope of work.  High Light Electric, Inc. has completed utility undergrounding for Southern California public agency projects, including the County of Los Angeles and several CalTrans projects. Reference agencies reported that the firm completed quality work, utilized appropriate safety measures, and completed projects in a timely manner. Staff also verified with the Contractors State License Board that High Light Electric, Inc. Contractor’s license is current, active, and in good standing.  Based upon these criteria, High Light Electric, Inc. is recommended as the best bidder to provide Utility Undergrounding and Excavation services . 	\N	13
64	Home-Sharing and Accessory Dwelling Units	Planning and Community Development	At its February 28, 2017 meeting, Council adopted changes, corrections, and clarifications to the Zoning Ordinance including changes related to Accessory Dwelling Units ; however, necessary concurrent changes to the home-sharing ordinance w ere not made .  During the first reading of the proposed ordinance, Council directed staff to include language restricting the use of an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) for a residential rental of 30 days or less.  According to the record, Council’s direction was intended to prevent a newly constructed ADU from being used as a Vacation Rental, as defined by the Santa Monica Municipal Code (SMMC). The ordinance was adopted on Second Reading on February 28, 2017 and effective March 30, 2017.  However, Santa Monica Municipal Code Section 6.20.020 provides that if any provision of Chapter 6.20 conflicts with any provision of the Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 6.20 shall prevail.  As such, in order to fully effectuate Council’s direction, it is necessary to also amend Chapter 6.20 SMMC. 	Section 9.21.020 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code (SMMC) established standards for Accessory Buildings and Structures.  Accessory Structures are detached subordinate structures used only as incidental to the main structure on the same parcel.  Examples of Accessory Buildings and Structures include but are not limited to greenhouses, storage sheds, workshops, garages, and other structures that are detached from the main building.  Accessory Buildings and Structures may only be constructed on a parcel with a legally-permitted main building.  An Accessory Building may not contain a kitchen unless specifically permitted as an “Accessory Dwelling Unit” (ADU) pursuant to SMMC Section 9. 31.300.  Additionally an Accesso ry Building may only contain a sink and toilet, but may not have a shower or tub unless specifically permitted as an ADU.  As such an Accessory Building or Structure is considered an extension of the main building, whereas if it is permitted as an Accessory Dwelling Unit it would provide complete independent living facilities and would therefore be considered a Single Dwelling Unit, consistent with California Government Code Section 65852.2.   On December 14, 2016, the Planning Commission adopted a Resolution recommending to the City Council that, among other changes, corrections, and clarifications to the Zoning Ordinance (ZO), staff should be directed to make changes related to Accessory Dwelling Units to be consistent with recent changes in State law. (See Attachment A)  During the first reading of the ordinance at the February 14, 2017 Council meeting (see Attachment B ) , Council directed staff to include language restricting the use of a newly constructed Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) for a residential rental of 30 days or less.  At its February 28, 2017 meeting, Council adopted changes, corrections, and clarifications to the ZO including the changes related to Accessory Dwelling Units ; however necessary concurrent changes to SMMC Chapter 6.20 were not made . (See Attachment D) 	 The City’s Home-Sharing Ordinance (Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 6.20) currently regulates home-sharing and vacation rental activities.  Additionally, Chapter 6.20 supersedes the Zoning Ordinance as it relates to the regulation and enforcement of Home-Sharing Ordinance / vacation rental activities.  Accordingly when there is a conflict, Chapter 6.20 would prevail.  Under existing law , a person is allowed to authorize exclusive transient uses in any accessory structure, including a guest house, when the entire property is designated for a single family residential use and when the host remains in the main-house .  Of the 195 active home-sharing business licenses , 37 business licenses are for “guest houses,” or 19%.  When the home-sharing ordinance was adopted, the application and registration process was intentionally made as simple as possible to encourage voluntary registration.  This was based on the research of other cities that were experiencing difficulty in getting hosts to register.  This included: no special permitting fees, a streamlined application process, and no on-site inspections.  When the program was launched staff did on occasion conduct exterior visual inspections of properties primarily as an educational tool. However, staff has not completed any interior inspections due to the increased resources that would be necessary and the potential deterrent to registration. Home-sharing permits are valid for one year at a time and thus must be renewed annually.   Under the proposed ordinance, an ADU which received its building permit on or after March 31, 2017 would constitute a separate dwelling unit and thus could not be occupied by exclusive transient uses.  ADUs with building permits prior to March 31, 2017 or any non-ADU accessory structures (e.g. an Accessory Structure or Building which may not contain a kitchen or may only contain a sink and toilet but not a shower) , could continue to be occupied by exclusive transient uses.   The proposed ordinance also makes a minor clarification to the definition of “Vacation Rental” to provide greater clarity and to align with existing regulations. In order to effectuate Council’s direction, Staff will update the administrative regulations and home-sharing business license application package prior to the 2017/18 renewal cycle to more clearly reflect the distinction between an Accessory Structure or Building from an Accessory Dwelling Unit. The Council could choose to eliminate exclusive transient uses for all ADUs, including ADUs with building permits prior to March 31, 2017.  If so, staff recommends allowing any existing ADUs with home-sharing permits to continue existing operations until the expiration of their annual home-sharing permit.  	\N	13
65	Bergamot Station Arts Center	Economic Development Division, Housing and Economic Development	The future of Bergamot Station, one of Santa Monica’s most prominent arts assets, has been the subject of lengthy discussion, particularly in the context of the long-anticipated arrival of a regional light-rail station last year.  With the expiration of the current master lease on December 31, 2017 and the completion of the work of the Bergamot Advisory Committee, staff seeks Council direction regarding a preliminary plan for the Arts Center advanced by the Worthe Real Estate Group development team (Worthe Group), pursuant to Council’s guidelines and input from the Advisory Committee. Staff recommends extending the exclusive negotiating agreement with the Worthe Group for three years with two, one-year options to accommodate an entitlement process for development consistent with the preliminary plan for the site.  During that time, an arts center management plan (as recommended by the Arts Commission) would be developed to ensure the area fully realizes its potential as a community cultural asset. Additionally, staff seeks authorization to enter into an interim, master ground lease with the Worthe Group for a period of three years with two, one-year options to commence on January 1, 2018, pursuant to parameters identified in the staff report, including that existing tenants would be offered leases with annual increases of no more than the increase in the consumer price index for up to three years . 	Bergamot Station Arts Center at 2525 Michigan Avenue consists of City ‑ owned land and private land.  The City-owned land (Site) was purchased in 1989 with transit funds with the goal of serving future transit needs in Santa Monica, including providing a source of revenue for the Big Blue Bus (BBB).  It was anticipated that the Site would be reserved for future transportation-related development adjacent to a future light-rail transit stop, but the timing for development of the light-rail line and station adjacent to the Site was speculative at the time the Site was acquired and for many years thereafter.  The Site consists of approximately five  acres with five buildings totaling approximately 62,000 square feet of total building space that is subleased to approximately 27  small, creative  tenants, including art galleries, designers, a nonprofit theatre company, and a café.  The space was master-leased to Wayne Blank, who spearheaded its creation (along with the adjacent private land he owned) into a unique constellation of private art galleries and related arts uses, including a theater and formerly an arts museum.  The City currently receives $552,553 annually in ground rent.  The  master lease has had relatively short terms since its initiation as the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) developed and implemented plans for light-rail service to Santa Monica along the adjacent rail right-of-way.  Construction of Metro’s Exposition light-rail line (Expo) ultimately required a portion of the Site to be sold to  Metro.  The  remainder of the Site remained subject to the master lease, which expires on December  31,  2017.  The Bergamot Station Arts Center complex also includes approximately 1.3 acres of privately owned adjacent land with approximately 30,000 square feet of building space that houses approximately ten galleries and other creative businesses. The private portion was owned and managed by Wayne Blank, who holds the master lease to the City-owned portion of the Arts Center. Mr. Blank sold the property in December 2016.  The Site and building layout, as well as adjacent properties, are shown in Illustration 1 below. Illustration 1 – Aerial Site Plan The Bergamot Area Plan governs the privately owned and publically owned portions of the Arts Center.  In 2011, in anticipation of the opening of the Expo line and a light-rail station located immediately adjacent to the Arts Center, the City began planning for the Art Center’s future as part of the Bergamot Area Plan process. Council adopted the Bergamot Area Plan in 2013.  It designates the Site as a Conservation Arts Center Zone with a total floor-to-area-ratio (FAR) of 1.0, or one times the parcel size as the total permitted amount of development, reflecting the lowest allowed commercial density in Santa Monica.  The Site is both highly strategic and highly sensitive for the future of both transportation and local culture – as well as the fiscal sustainability of Big Blue Bus in a time of dynamic change in transit economics.  While some advocate for no changes to the current status quo, the opening of Expo, the sale of the adjacent, privately owned portion of Bergamot Station Arts Center, ongoing changes in the fine-art business, and the closing of the Santa Monica Museum of Art all point to the need to plan for the future vitality of Bergamot Station.  Pursuant to Council direction, the City issued a request for qualifications for revitalization of the  Site in July 2012, followed by a request for proposals  (RFP) in February 2013.  The RFP included eight goals for the Site, which were adopted as policy goals in the Bergamot Area Plan and further endorsed by Council on March  20,  2012 (Attachment A) for guiding Bergamot’s future development.  The eight policy goals for the revitalization of the Site were as follows: 1.  Include at least 75,000 square feet of arts-related space (equivalent to the arts-related square footage currently on-site at that time) that is affordable to nonprofit cultural arts organizations and for-profit art galleries, with emphasis on retaining existing Bergamot Station Arts Center tenants.  2.  Include open space, infrastructure, and other amenities to support public access to the light-rail station as well as improving the environment and functionality of the Site.  3.  Maximize the preservation of existing buildings, where feasible.  Retaining the character of the Arts Center is very important to the community and City.  4.  Incorporate additional uses, which support the Site as a cultural destination, including evening and weekend activation, and uses that help generate revenue for the development.  These uses should include a hotel, restaurant/bar, shared community meeting room/performance space and could include creative office and cultural uses that will maximize market opportunities and create a vibrant development.  5.  Consider the LUCE (Land Use Circulation Element) parking approaches and shared parking opportunities.  6.  Produce ground lease payments for the City.  It is the expectation that the lease rates will be based upon fair market values taking into consideration the other development objectives.  7.  Exemplify exceptional architecture and sustainable design and construction as well as have a focused, transit-oriented development approach to design, site layout, and view corridors.  8.  Exemplify the concepts identified in the Bergamot Area Plan process.  Three proposals were submitted in response to the RFP. On September 9, 2014, Council selected the Worthe Group as the City’s development partner and authorized staff to enter into exclusive negotiations as well as directed staff to form a community advisory committee to help refine the conceptual plan for the Site (Attachment B). Council did not adopt the Worthe Group’s original development proposal.  The City entered into an exclusive negotiation agreement (ENA) with the Worthe Group on April  30, 2015, that is set to expire on August 30, 2017.   A full record of the RFQ/RFP process and associated documents are available at the project website: www.smgov.net/Bergamot . Bergamot Station Advisory Committee and Guidelines To advise on future planning for the Site, on February 10, 2015, Council approved the creation of an eleven-member Bergamot Advisory Committee (Attachment C), which was composed of representatives of the Bergamot Station Gallery and Cultural Association, Santa Monica Neighborhood Council, Arts Commission, Chamber of Commerce, and Santa Monica Travel and Tourism (Attachment D).  Also at the February 10, 2015 meeting, Council adopted a set of six guidelines for the revitalization of the City-owned Bergamot Station Arts Center property and defined the role of the Bergamot Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee). The guidelines were consistent with the project goals included in the RFP and vision of the Site as outlined in the Bergamot Area Plan. The six guidelines adopted by Council to direct the work of the Advisory Committee were as follows: 1.  The project shall seek to minimize displacement and disruption to the fine art galleries and other creative businesses on the Site.  2.  The project shall incorporate space for additional nonprofit cultural uses.  3.  The project shall support the Expo Station and bus integration through amenities and services, including consideration of facilities such as public restrooms.  4.  The project shall incorporate a permanent home for a museum or other significant cultural institution that can demonstrate the ability to finance tenant improvements and ongoing operations while providing a cultural experience that benefits the Santa Monica community.  5.  The Site has customarily generated $622,000 of annual ground rent.  The project shall maintain and increase that ground rent amount over time in order to provide a consistent revenue source for the Big Blue Bus (BBB).  6.  The project shall generate additional municipal revenues that could be used to supplement BBB funds.  Bergamot Station Advisory Committee Process and Recommendations The  Advisory Committee  held its inaugural meeting on April 15, 2015, and met monthly for a year to provide recommendations regarding the preliminary plan for the revitalization of the Arts Center, working within the Council guidelines for the Site. The  meetings were open to the public and conducted under Brown Act open-meeting requirements. The Housing and Economic Development Department provided staff support to the Advisory Committee and the Worthe Group attended all meetings and participated throughout the process. Meeting agendas, minutes, audio recordings, and presentations were made available on the project website: www.smgov.net/Bergamot .  The Advisory Committee received presentations and diligently reviewed relevant background information on various topics such as the Bergamot Area Plan, current uses at the Arts Center, current and proposed BBB and Expo services to the Site, amenities for transit users, and the City Yards Master Plan and proposed shared-parking structure. The Advisory Committee also sought input from Wayne Blank, founder of Bergamot Station Arts Center, and invited input from individual Bergamot tenants to understand the elements that help make Bergamot special, as well as the on-going facility and operational requirements to continue to support a vibrant arts center.  Based on the review of background information, the Advisory Committee asked the Worthe Group to review and explain the mix of uses of the original proposal.  The  original proposal that the Worthe Group submitted in response to the City’s RFP served as a baseline for the Advisory Committee’s initial review, in order to understand the rationale for the mix of uses and proposed square footage attributed to each use, as well as the economics of the proposal. The Advisory Committee also reviewed and commented on key deliverables for the implementation and management of the Arts Center in order to address issues such as construction phasing, parking management, urban design, site management, infrastructure, overall Site improvements, and an arts-center management plan.  The Advisory Committee discussed and adopted formal recommendations regarding each type of use and the associated amount of building square footage, building height, and general locations on the Site. In response to the Advisory Committee’s feedback and recommendations, the Worthe Group revised and updated the preliminary plan, acknowledging that revitalization of the Arts Center would need to be built in phases to minimize disruption to and displacement of the existing tenants. The Advisory Committee also determined that off-site parking would need to be constructed before significant revitalization could  occur. The  opportunity to develop a shared parking structure at the City Yards was identified as critical to the Art Center revitalization.  The  Advisory Committee agreed with the need for offsite parking to replace the existing surface parking at the Site in order to create attractive, flexible open space at the Site to support art events, public art, outdoor dining, and public gathering space.  The Public Works Department has incorporated the Art Center’s parking need and shared parking structure concept into the City Yards master planning process.  The Advisory Committee was unable to reach consensus on the inclusion of a hotel within the mix of uses at the Arts Center and a majority of Advisory Committee members (six of eleven total) ultimately voted against inclusion of a hotel in the project.  In addition to its review of uses and locations, the committee evaluated the financial projections of the original proposal and revised plan. To facilitate the Advisory Committee ’ s efforts, staff produced a matrix of the Arts Center key deliverables and the Advisory Committee comments and motions made at each meeting (Attachment E). 	 Following the completion of the Advisory Committee’s work, staff requested that the Worthe Team update the preliminary plan and financial projections based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee.  The Worthe Group’s revised preliminary plan addresses most of the Advisory Committee’s recommendations regarding uses and square footage, while preserving four of the five buildings (Buildings A, B, E, and  F). However, the Worthe Group’s revised preliminary plan includes a hotel, which is  described further in the report. The preliminary plan proposes six new buildings (Buildings C, D, G, H, I, and M) providing additional space for galleries and nonprofit cultural uses, a museum, a community center, restaurant/café space, and creative office space, as well as a hotel that would include additional space for galleries and restaurant/café uses.  Removal of the on-site surface parking would create over three acres of flexible open space for cultural events, community programming, and use by the public and tenants. Table 1 below outlines the types of uses, associated square footage of each plan, and compares the Worthe Group’s original proposal responding to the City’s  RFP, the Advisory Committee’s recommendations, and the Worthe Group’s revised plan based on the Advisory Committee process.

Illustration 2 – Revised Preliminary Plan Museum Space – Building M The Worthe Group originally proposed the museum space to be located immediately adjacent to the Expo Station in a newly constructed 21,100-square-foot, two-story  building.  Based on the Advisory Committee’s review and recommendation, the  museum concept was revised to be composed of two buildings above ground totaling 9,000 square feet with an additional 12,100 square feet of below-grade space to connect the two buildings above ground.  The Advisory Committee felt that a single, two-story building as originally proposed might create a visual and physical barrier between the Expo Station and the Site.  During the review process, the committee recommended that the building include a minimum 1,000 square feet (up to 2,000 square feet) of food- service space for coffee and carry-out food options to serve museum patrons, Expo riders, area workers, and local residents.  Pursuant to zoning ordinance standards, below-grade museum space would not count towards the project’s floor-to-area ratio.  Gallery and Nonprofit Cultural Uses – Buildings A, B, C, D, E and F The Advisory Committee evaluated the amount of existing building space at the Arts Center utilized by gallery and cultural uses, as well as what the Worthe Group originally proposed.  The committee initially recommended that a minimum of 61,600 square feet be dedicated to galleries and nonprofit cultural uses, excluding the museum. Later in the process, the committee recommended increasing the amount to 65,700 square feet and that two separate, 3,000-square-foot spaces for nonprofit performing arts uses be a part of the Arts Center. The  committee further recommended that City Garage, the nonprofit theatre group that is currently located at the Arts Center, be prioritized for one of the two performing arts  spaces. The committee also recommended that priority of leasing opportunities be offered to existing tenants of the Site first, followed by tenants of the privately owned portion of Bergamot Station when space is available. As the conceptual site plan was revised, the gallery and nonprofit cultural uses were designated to be located in the existing buildings on the Site (Buildings A, B, E and F) as well as in the ground floor of two of the new buildings proposed on the Site (Buildings C and D).  Creative Office – Building C The proposed creative office space provides a revenue stream to help subsidize the museum, gallery, and nonprofit cultural spaces at the Arts Center and helps support the ground-lease payment to the BBB. The Worthe Group’s original proposal included 44,000 square feet of creative office space in two new buildings of two stories in height located at the southeast corner of the Site adjacent to City Yards and Agensys. The  Advisory Committee recommended that the amount of office space be reduced by 14,000 square feet to a total of 30,000 square feet and be located in only one new building (Building C). To maximize the open space and prioritize the art uses throughout the Site, the Advisory Committee recommended that the office use be located in the two upper floors of Building C with the 15,000 square feet on the ground floor committed to gallery and nonprofit cultural uses.  Restaurant and Café Spaces – Buildings G and M The Advisory Committee recommended that the proposed enclosed restaurant and café space of 5,000 square feet be located in the center of the Site in a new structure (Building G) with the benefit of outdoor dining space in order to help activate the Arts Center. The committee further recommended that up to 2,000 square feet of “grab-n-go” café and coffee bar space be located in the museum building (Illustration 2), with the understanding that outdoor dining space would not count toward the project’s floor-to-area ratio.  Community Center with Adjacent Open Space – Building I The Advisory Committee advocated for increasing the amount of building space dedicated for community space from the originally proposed 2,000 square feet to 4,000 square feet in a new structure (Building I).  The revised preliminary plan includes a centrally located community center with connecting open space of up to 10,000 square feet to allow for a fluid connection of indoor/outdoor activities, including community art exhibits, workshops, film and music events, and other events for the community.  The community center is proposed for the center of the Site, adjacent to the restaurant, in order to serve as an overflow food venue for larger-scale events when needed.  Arts-Related Uses – Building D The Advisory Committee recommended that the originally proposed creative office building be redesigned into two new structures (Buildings C and D) and that Building D be focused on arts-related uses instead of creative office. The Advisory Committee endorsed Building D for market-rate arts-related uses on the second floor, totaling 9,000 square feet, with the ground floor’s 9,000 square feet dedicated to gallery and nonprofit cultural uses of which 4,100 square feet be at market rate with the remainder of the gallery and nonprofit cultural space be provided at below market rate.   Bike Center The Worthe Group’s original proposal included a 4,600-square-foot bike center to be located in the center of the Site. The Advisory Committee expressed concerns regarding the proposed location, size, potential demand and prospective users. The  Advisory Committee ultimately recommended a bike center of 600 square feet to be located in the shared parking structure or toward the south side of the Site near Michigan Avenue.  Hotel – Building H The Bergamot Area Plan identifies preferred use concepts for the Arts Center, which includes a hotel with a restaurant or café that could serve as an amenity for the Arts Center and larger Bergamot Area and help activate the Arts Center beyond standard gallery operating hours.  The hotel would also provide an economic benefit to the City/BBB, even though the expected ground lease revenue would be constrained due to the limited allowed FAR and the large amount of subsidized uses planned for the Site. The  preferred concept suggests a location at the western edge of the Site adjacent to 26 th Street. The RFQ/RFP issued for the Arts Center referenced the preferred use concepts, including the hotel, which was part of all three proposals submitted for revitalization of the Site. The Worthe Group’s original proposal included a seven-story, 120-room, art-centric boutique hotel in the range of 80,000 to 83,000 square feet that included a roof-top bar, restaurant, conference room, and ground-floor art uses with subterranean parking spaces to serve the hotel guests and employees.  The hotel’s height was originally proposed at 86 feet, the maximum permitted height under the Bergamot Area Plan.   The Advisory Committee spent several meetings reviewing the original proposed hotel use and related financial projections and asked the Worthe Group to evaluate the financial feasibility of a reduced-scale hotel of 80 rooms and 4 to 5 stories.  In response, the Worthe Group analyzed a smaller hotel concept and determined that a hotel under 100 rooms would not be economically viable to operate or finance within the overall project, the limited market of hotel brands that service less than 100-room hotels and the inefficiencies of operating a hotel of that size.  Advisory Committee member Richard Peterson who was with the Santa Monica Travel and Tourism organization at the time acknowledged to the committee that this was his understanding of hotel operations as well. However, the Worthe Group presented a reduced hotel concept of six stories, 100 rooms with 70,800 square feet of building area at a height between 65 feet to 75 feet. The Advisory Committee approved the 100-room, six-story hotel use as presented with the understanding that it would be classified as a Tier 2 project within the zoning policies of the Bergamot Area Plan.  The proposed location of the hotel was located on the west side of the Site adjacent to 26 th Street in the location of the existing T Building.  At the following Advisory Committee meeting, the committee rescinded their previous approval upon confirming with staff that the 100-room, six-story hotel concept of 65-75 feet would be classified as a Tier 3 development under the Bergamot Area Plan because it would exceed the 60-foot height limit for Tier 2 projects.  The Worthe Group and Advisory Committee evaluated a five-story hotel with a 100 rooms, but both parties agreed that expanding the footprint of the hotel to achieve a 5-story concept with 100 rooms was too impactful to the Site’s open space and view corridor.  A majority of the Advisory Committee members ultimately voted against a 65- to 75-foot hotel at the Site.  A majority of the Advisory Committee had concerns regarding the hotel based primarily on the following three elements: ·  that hotel construction would have severe impacts on the Arts Center businesses and operations,  ·  that the hotel would not be synergistic with the Arts Center, and ·  that the proposed height of six to seven stories would overshadow and be out of scale with the Site. A minority of Advisory Committee members (five of the eleven members) supported the hotel, noting the additional services and economic benefits the hotel would bring to the project, including unionized jobs for local residents, transient occupancy tax revenue to support City and BBB operations, additional dining and nightlife amenities for nearby residents and workers, synergies with Art Center uses including additional gallery and event space, and proximity to the Expo station to serve transit users.  Both hotel concepts (a six-story, 100-room project or seven-story, 120-room project) evaluated included 2,000 square feet of restaurant space and 3,000 square feet of gallery or event space, resulting in a modest increase in both uses on the Site.  If the hotel or an alternative use/building for the proposed location is not included in the Art Center’s preliminary plan, the T Building and its approximately 11,214 square feet of the building space would be retained. The Advisory Committee did not evaluate or recommend a use for the T Building space, though staff assumes that the space would continue to be made available for gallery and nonprofit cultural uses.  Building Preservation The Advisory Committee’s recommendations preserves five buildings (approximately 52,900 square feet of existing building space) on the Site, recognizing that the existing A Building would be partially demolished by approximately half to accommodate the new C Building. The Worthe Group’s revised preliminary plan would require demolition of the T Building to accommodate the proposed hotel, in which case four buildings (approximately 41,700 square feet of existing building space) would be retained.  Open Space and Parking The Site has abundant open space which serves the Art Center as a surface parking lot currently.  The Advisory Committee recommended that the surface parking be retained until replacement parking is built off site, with the exception of implementing modest landscaping, open space, or other site modifications. Additionally, the committee recommended that the Worthe Group reserve as much peripheral surface parking on-site as needed for the existing galleries and nonprofit cultural uses to conduct business. The Worthe Group proposes to provide the code-required amount of parking for the Arts Center in the proposed shared City Yards Parking Garage, while maintaining a limited amount of on-site surface parking for disabled parking and loading requirements. The Worthe Group would be obligated to finance or lease the Arts Center parking in the proposed shared City Yards Parking Garage. Once the off-site, replacement parking is constructed, the reclaimed open space that totals over three acres, is envisioned to be integrated into the overall Site as a public gathering space that can used for a wide range of art, cultural, and community events.  Advisory Committee’s Report The Advisory Committee concluded its efforts by adopting a Bergamot Advisory Committee Recommendation Report that summarizes the committee’s review, financial projections, and recommendations, as well as positions of the minority  vote. The  Bergamot Advisory Committee’s report was provided to Council on May 17, 2016 (Attachment F) and posted on the project website ( www.smgov.net/Bergamot ). The  Advisory Committee also made recommendations addressing key project deliverables such as parking management, construction phasing, infrastructure and site improvements, and the Arts Center management plan.  If Council authorizes continuing forward with a preliminary plan, the Worthe Group would be required to prepare architectural plans, finalize financial pro-forma analysis, and prepare related key project deliverables, which would be incorporated into the development agreement and ground-lease contracts.  Economic and Fiscal Impacts  Recognizing the overall duration of the project to date, starting with the initial qualification submissions in 2012 through the Advisory Committee review process in 2015/2016, staff requested that the Worthe Group update its financial pro-forma for the revised preliminary plan based on current costs and rental rates.  The City’s financial consultant, Keyser Marston Associates, Inc. (KMA), reviewed the updated financial pro-formas, analyzed whether the preliminary uses could support the proposed ground-lease payments and construction costs, and estimated the amount of public revenues that the City would receive annually from revitalization of the  Site.  Project Pro-forma When the Advisory Committee conducted their review of the Worthe Group’s concept plans, the financial estimates were based on the original proposal’s cost estimates from  2013. Construction and financing costs have been updated by the Worthe Group and are incorporated in an updated financial pro-forma (Attachment G).  The estimated construction costs for the revised preliminary plan without the hotel have increased by approximately 11 percent (from $22.2 million in total hard and soft costs to $24.6 million) and the updated pro-formas now include the combined possessory interest and property tax expenses that the plan is expected to incur.  The rental revenue cash flows were also updated to reflect the below-market rents the Art Center tenants currently pay adjusted for consumer price index, and the phasing of the plan.  The revitalization of the Arts Center requires significant financial investment in order to upgrade the Site’s infrastructure and existing buildings, and to construct the new improvements and a shared parking structure.  The total estimated costs of the revised preliminary plans are $39.6 million for the plan that does not include a hotel and $95.1 million for the plan that includes a 120-room hotel.  Using Worthe’s assumptions, staff asked KMA to model the cost to construct a 100-room hotel, which KMA estimated at $85.7 million.  Net cash flow from the plan without a hotel before consideration of debt service and return on capital is estimated to be approximately $2.2 million in the first year of full build-out and approximately $6.4 million in the first year of full build-out for the plan with a 120-room hotel.  Net cash flow is expected to grow over time as revenues grow.  When debt service and return on capital are considered, the plan without a hotel is not expected to repay the capital investors until 2058.  The plan with a hotel is not expected to repay the capital investors until 2045.  Assuming a 55-year ground lease, the net present value of the net cash flow after debt service and repayment of capital, assuming a 10 percent discount rate, is $4.5 million for the plan without a hotel and $25.8 million for the plan with a hotel.  The net present value provides a means to estimate the Worthe Group’s estimated profit over the life of the ground lease.  It should be noted that the financial pro-formas are preliminary, order-of-magnitude estimates used to test the feasibility of the land-use scenarios.  If the plan moves forward, KMA would complete a detailed financial evaluation of the plan as it is further defined.  During the preliminary phase, staff asked KMA to provide initial feedback on the Worthe Group’s pro-forma.  KMA comments include: ·  The loan-to-capital ratio of 65 percent is low compared to most commercial developments, which typically leverage a greater amount of debt.  The Worthe Group has responded that they are able to attract a greater amount of capital to their plans.  ·  The net developer profit is low compared to the overall size of the development.  The Worthe Group has responded that they are able to accept lower overall returns because of their long-term investment horizon.  ·  The time period for repayment of the initial capital investment is extremely long, particularly in the scenario without a hotel.  The Worthe Group has responded that their investors are accustomed to longer windows of return on investment, though they acknowledge that the extended time period for the plan without a hotel would face greater challenges in attracting capital.  ·  Based on the Worthe Group’s Operating Pro-forma and Cash Flow Projections, KMA confirmed that the Worthe Group has the capacity and access to capital to finance the different preliminary plan uses being considered.  While the City could take the position that financing is purely a developer’s risk, if the Worthe Group is unable to attract debt and capital financing, revitalization of the Arts Center might be delayed.  In addition, the Worthe Group’s pro-forma assumes that the developer would construct and operate a shared parking structure at the City Yards.  Staff believes the concept requires significant further discussion and negotiation between the City and the Worthe Group if the plan moves forward.  Estimated Public Revenues Attachment H identifies estimated annual City revenues of the revised preliminary plan. As noted in Attachment H and highlighted in Table 2 below, the annual City revenues from a preliminary plan without a hotel would generate approximate $1.3 million in annual City revenue.  Annual City revenues from a preliminary plan that includes a 120-room hotel use is approximately $2.9 million.  KMA estimated the annual City revenues from a hypothetical 100-room hotel at approximately $2.6 million. The most notable difference among the scenarios are the estimated property tax and transient occupancy tax revenues related to a hotel.   Table 2 - Annual Estimated Revenue to the City    Ground Lease Payment $700,000 $700,000 $700,000 Transit Occupancy Tax $0 $1,226,000 $1,472,000 City Share of Property Taxes $55,000 $119,000 $132,000 Total Estimated Tax Revenue to City’s General Fund $640,000 $1,933,000 $2,195,000    Lastly, the Worthe Group has committed to a minimum ground rent of $700,000 under each scenario; however, annual ground rent payments are typically equal to a percentage of the supportable land value.  If the plan moves forward, KMA would develop a detailed evaluation of the refined plan and its financial pro-forma, in order to support negotiation of a ground-lease structure and profit-sharing opportunities associated with the market-rate uses.  Market-Rate Uses and Below-Market-Rate Use An early policy direction that was included in the RFQ/RFP was the intent of preserving gallery and nonprofit cultural uses at the Arts Center. The City envisioned that the rental rates for cultural uses would be provided at below-market rates, with the recognition that nonprofit arts and cultural space would be discounted at a higher rate than for-profit gallery space. Likewise, it was envisioned that the Site would accommodate market-rate uses such as creative office, restaurants, and a hotel to help offset the below-market rents of the art spaces. The Worthe Group has maintained these lease rate expectations in their financial pro-forma analysis that they have produced throughout the process. The  Advisory Committee recommendation limits the market-rate uses on the Site to 31  percent of the total building square footage, with the remaining 69 percent of the building space at below-market rates. The revised plan by the Worthe Group that includes a 120-room hotel adjusts the balance of building space to 43 percent subsidized space and 57 percent market-rate use.  KMA notes that a balance, at a minimum closer to a 50/50 split of below-market and market-rate uses would be more sustainable for the plan by providing more reliable and diverse long-term income to support the below-market uses.  A hotel could also support the Art Center tenants by providing a regular stream of visitors to the Site, including supporting restaurants that could incorporate evening service beyond typical gallery hours.  Council Guidelines The Advisory Committee was thoughtful in considering the Council’s guidelines in their recommendations regarding the preliminary plan and mix of uses. The following section briefly discussed each of the Council’s guidelines for the revitalization of the Arts Center with respect to the Advisory Committee’s recommendations.  Minimize displacement and disruption to the fine art galleries and other creative businesses on the Site – Retention of existing Bergamot tenants is a priority shared by all participants.  The Advisory Committee’s recommendations related to phased construction, temporary relocation options, leasing priority for displaced tenants, off-site parking, and outreach and signage during construction all speak to minimizing impacts on existing tenants.  A majority of the Committee also voted against inclusion of a hotel on the Site, which would further minimize disruption, and likely continue to make Building T available for existing creative tenants.  Incorporate space for additional nonprofit arts and cultural uses - The Advisory Committee’s recommendations would allocate the amount of space available for nonprofit arts and cultural uses by up to 65,700 square feet.  If Building T were retained as cultural-focused space, an additional 11,214 square feet could be available for nonprofit cultural  uses. Support the Expo Station and bus integration through amenities and services (e.g. public restroom, bike center) – The Advisory Committee envisioned the museum and adjoining café as a prominent gateway, helping to visually promote and integrate the Arts Center with the Expo Bergamot Station.  Although reduced in size from the original Worthe Group proposal, the Advisory Committee also recommended a bike center of 600 square feet in the preliminary plan.  Add a permanent home for a museum or other significant cultural institution – The Advisory Committee recommended a 21,100-square-foot museum building adjacent to the Expo station. Generate a minimum of $622,000/year ground lease payment, to be increased over time as a revenue source for Big Blue Bus – The Developer has proposed to set the annual ground rent at $700,000 for each of the three plan scenarios.  However, these amounts may be revised up or down based upon further feasibility testing once a more detailed development program is approved. Generate additional municipal revenues that could be used to supplement Big Blue Bus funds. – The role of the Site as a BBB revenue-producing asset adds additional complexity to the overall plan.  BBB’s revenues come from a variety of sources, including federal, state, and regional funds, farebox revenue, advertising, and real estate income.  When Council voted to increased BBB fares in 2010, Council recognized that higher bus fares have a disproportionate impact on transit-dependent riders who are often at the lowest end of the economic spectrum.  Recognizing the impacts, Council directed staff to explore opportunities to maximize returns on BBB real estate in order to reduce pressure on bus fares.  Bergamot Station represents one of BBB’s primary real estate holdings.  If the City’s overriding goal were to maximize ground rent in order to reduce pressure on the BBB fares, significant ground rents could flow to the BBB from a long-term re-positioning of the property.  For example, the Papermate site, directly across Olympic Boulevard from the Arts Center, sold in 2015 for a reported price of over $500 per square foot of building area and nearly $400 per square foot of land area.  The Arts Center is arguably comparable in terms of location, and if maximizing its value was an overriding priority, it could be expected to command annual rents of several million dollars per year.  Given  that the BBB’s total passenger revenue is projected to be approximately $11 million in FY 2017/2018, generating several million dollars per year from the Arts Center site could dramatically reduce pressure on bus fares.  However, because the regulations and plans for the Arts Center envision a low floor-to-area ratio and many subsidized tenants, the expected ground rent to the BBB is not expected to increase significantly.  Not including the ground lease payment, a plan without a hotel is expected to generate approximately $640,000 annually in additional City revenues, relative to current City revenues of approximately $180,000 generated by the Site.  With the inclusion of a hotel, the plan is projected to generate between $1.9 million (100-room hotel) and $2.2 million (120-room hotel) annually in revenue to the City’s General Fund.  The  primary drivers of the increased revenues is Transient Occupancy Tax (with a hotel), supplemented by additional property taxes, and sales taxes.  Attachment H provides a summary of expected municipal revenues under the three scenarios. Additional municipal revenue derived from the Bergamot Arts Center would go to the City’s General Fund, though Council could choose to allocate some or all of the increased revenue to support the BBB, given the low ground-rents that are expected to accrue to the BBB.  The additional Bergamot ground rent revenue, coupled with any additional public revenues earmarked to the BBB, could help to reduce pressure on bus fares, as the BBB grapples with the cost increases that are similar to those facing the City generally (pension costs, workers compensation, health care), as well as revenue impacts related to regional and national declines in bus ridership.  Understanding that the Council has consistently reinforced that revenues from the Site should be used to keep fares low for Santa Monica residents and BBB customers, and that BBB has one of the lowest transit fares in the county, additional Site revenue could help BBB reduce pressure on fare increases.  As a result, the City’s choices regarding the project are expected to affect bus fares for BBB customers in the long run.    Alternatives for the Site Council could consider alternative approaches to the preliminary plan.  Council could direct the Worthe Group to pursue incorporation of either a 100-room, six-story hotel or a 120-room, seven-story hotel.  If Council does not support a hotel use on the Site, staff requests that Council provide direction on the desired use(s) for the T building (as either gallery, nonprofit arts use, cultural; restaurant/café or creative office) or if another use/building for the location be considered. Additional alternatives for Council consideration include retaining the existing uses, buildings, and conditions on the Site, including the surface parking and allowing the ENA with the Worthe Group to expire, though this approach would not address many of the guidelines established for the Site. Council could also direct staff to prepare a new RFP with revised project goals and directives, if the proposed preliminary plan is not deemed acceptable. The approach would delay implementation of many of the guidelines, as well as extending uncertainties as to the City’s plans for the Site, which could cause further concern to the current tenants and disruption to the on-going operations of the Arts Center. Exclusive Negotiating Agreement (ENA) The ENA between the City and the Worthe Group expires on August 31, 2017. If  Council is supportive of proceeding with the revitalization of the Arts Center and continuing to partner with the Worthe Group, staff recommends Council authorize an extension to the ENA. The recommended extension is for a term of three years with two, one-year options conditioned upon the Worthe Group working in good faith to implement the revised preliminary plan selected by Council. This extension time period will allow the Worthe Group to continue their efforts to obtain the necessary land use entitlements and approvals. There is no cost to either the City or the Worthe Group in extending the ENA. Interim Property Management The Master Lease Agreement with Bergamot Station Ltd. expires on December  31,  2017, at which time the existing tenants’ subleases and parking agreements on the Site will expire as they run concurrent with the master lease. Staff has identified four potential options for interim management or ground leasing for Council consideration. 1.  If Council decides to proceed with revitalization of the Arts Center and continue to partner with the Worthe Group, then the City could enter into an interim master lease with the Worthe Group to oversee the management of the Site until land-use entitlements are in place and a long-term ground lease is executed. This approach would provide the Worthe Group with an opportunity to begin working with the Arts Center tenants in advance of any significant revitalization.  2.  The City could extend the current lease with Mr. Blank (Bergamot Station Ltd.) during the interim, which could enable continuation of some of the existing arrangements, such as parking agreements with Agensys and the owner of the privately owned portion of the Arts Center.  3.  The City could act a direct lessor, with individual leases with each tenant and overall property management responsibility.  Because staff does not have capacity or expertise in providing direct property management, a property management contract would be necessary.  However, such an approach is not recommended because City oversight of leasing responsibilities could have negative consequences for the Arts Center, as each lease would be subject to the competitive public procurement process.  When vacancies occur, re-leasing could be significantly delayed, potentially creating extended vacancies that detract from the vitality of the Arts Center.  4.  Select a third-party, interim ground lessee who could manage the property and take responsibility for leasing.  Staff does not recommend such an approach as completing the process of procuring a ground lessee, as well as executing a ground lease, could extend beyond expiration of the current ground lease and create further uncertainty among Arts Center tenants. If Council approves the extension of the ENA with the Worthe Group, staff recommends that the City enter into an interim ground lease with the Worthe Group pursuant to the following parameters: A.  The term of the interim ground lease should be three years with two, one-year options at the City’s sole discretion. A revitalization plan could be expected to undergo environmental review, obtain entitlements, and enter into a long-term ground lease with the  City over a two to four-year period.  The interim ground lease would spell out what occurs until construction begins.  If the environmental review or entitlement period is extended beyond the three-year period, the ground lease options could be exercised. B.  During the term of the interim ground lease, sublease rents may increase by no more than the Consumer Price Index. Many Arts Center tenants’ continued viability is a concern if their subleases are subject to significant rent increases.  The proposed parameter is designed to ensure rent stability. C.  Ground rent to the BBB would increase each year by the Consumer Price Index. The proposed parameter would ensure that ground rent for BBB keeps pace with inflation during the interim. D.  To the extent that rental income exceeds operating costs, ground rent, and a fair return to the ground lessee, excess operating income would be invested in Site improvements and building repair and restoration. Arts Center tenants and patrons have noted a variety of building and Site improvements and other infrastructure  that are in need of upgrades.  The proposed parameter would ensure that excess income would be invested in the Site.  Commission Action Staff presented the preliminary plan, associated analysis, and interim site management options to the Arts Commission on April 17, 2017. Approximately 30 members of the public attended, including former members of the Bergamot Advisory Committee and Bergamot tenants. The commission had a variety of questions regarding the plan concepts and process going forward with particular concern raised about protecting the art uses at the Site. The Arts Commission met again on May 15, 2017 to develop their recommendations, with input from the Arts Commission’s Bergamot Ad Hoc Committee, which is comprised of five members of the Arts Commission.  Seventeen members of the public attended the meeting, including Bergamot tenants, City staff and the developer’s team.  The Arts Commission reviewed and discussed the Bergamot Ad Hoc Committee’s recommendations, which formed the Commission’s recommendations to Council.  The Arts Commission recommended that the ENA with the Worthe Group be extended for three years and that the Worthe Group be selected as the interim ground lessee. The  Commission also recommended a variety of leasing policies for the Site during the interim management of the Arts Center.  The Commission has committed to develop an arts management plan for the Arts Center with the assistance of a newly formed Arts Center management committee (Arts Management Committee) in which representatives comprised of Bergamot tenants and community representatives would be represented, following the form and guidelines established for the Public Art Committee of the Arts Commission. The  Arts Management Committee would prepare a draft arts management plan within twelve months to address curation of arts programming, guidelines for tenancy selection, and preserving the art uses and architectural character of Bergamot.  The Committee would report back to the Arts Commission to recommend an Arts Management Plan to Council.  The Arts Commission incorporated their overall recommendations in a memo (Attachment I).  In addition, the Worthe Group submitted a letter to the Arts Commission (Attachment J) in which Worthe proposes to form a non-profit organization to implement the Arts Center Management Plan.  The organization would be funded by the Worthe Group annually by $270,000 with additional annual fundraising efforts. The non-profit organization would have a board comprised of representatives of the Arts Commission, the Worthe Group, and community members to advise the organization’s staff who would be responsible for community programming, oversee an artist residency program and other programs, coordination of gallery openings and Arts Center events, and assisting with tenant selection.  Environmental Analysis If a preliminary plan moves forward into entitlements and ground-lease negotiations, environmental analysis pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) will be necessary.  Providing conceptual direction regarding a preliminary plan is exempt from CEQA.  Next Steps If Council provides direction to move forward with a preliminary plan and approves extending the ENA, the Worthe Group would prepare conceptual plans and a development agreement application, solicit additional community feedback, and provide float-up presentations to the Architectural Review Board and Planning Commission.  Following the Planning Commission float-up, the project would return to the Council for conceptual approval of initial business terms regarding the lease of the property and authorization to enter into development agreement negotiations. With Council direction, staff would then prepare environmental analysis and negotiate a development agreement and a disposition and development agreement. The project would proceed in tandem with the City Yards Master Plan process in regards to negotiating the terms of the parking arrangement within a shared parking structure, and the two efforts would continue to be coordinated.   	\N	13
66	Appointment to one unscheduled vacancy on the Audit Subcommittee for a term ending on 06/30/2019	City Clerk 13-Items	\N	\N	\N	\N	13
67	Electronic Filing of Statement of Economic Interests	Records & Elections Services Department	Designated officials and employees are required to file Statements of Economic Interest based on the City’s Conflict of Interest Code and the Political Reform Act .  The resolution would require these filings to be submitted electronically , saving paper, time and postage, and increasing transparency and access to statements online. 	In 2014, the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC), approved the City’s use of NetFile for Statements of Economic Interest (Form 700). On January 26, 2016, the City Council adopted Resolution Number 10931 (CCS) amending the City's Conflict of Interest Code to revise the designated positions for which Statements of Economic Interest are required to be filed.  Currently the filers may file electronically or on paper.  The proposed resolution would mandate electronic filing of Statements of Economic Interest . This mandate is not anticipated to be a hardship since 92% of the City’s 655 filers currently utilize the electronic filing system. 	Elected officials and public employees who make or influence governmental decisions are required to submit a Statement of Economic Interest, also known as the Form 700. The Form 700 provides transparency and ensures accountability by providing personal financial interests to ensure that officials are making decisions in the best interest of the public and not enhancing their personal finances.  Additionally, it serves as a reminder to public officials of potential conflicts so the official can abstain from making or participating in governmental decisions that are deemed as conflicts of interest. Annual statements are due on April 1 of each year.  Additionally, statements must be filed within 30 days of assuming or leaving office.  Statements of Economic Interests are public documents. The City Clerk’s Office must permit any member of the public to inspect and receive a copy of any statement.  Statements must be available as soon as possible during regular business hours, but in any event not later than the second business day after the statement is received.  Access to the Form 700 is not subject to the Public Records Act procedures , pursuant to the Political Reform Act .  Currently filers may utilize the City’s electronic filing system Netfile, or may file an original paper statement.  Electronic filings will promote the City’s continuing efforts of transparency and sustainability and ensure consistency and availability to the public. The requirement for electronic filing will be added to Exhibit 2 of the City’s last ad opted Conflict of Interest Code.  Alternatives Although not ideal, t he City could continue to allow both paper and electronic filings. Limiting the filing method to one method and using the full functionality of the software creates consistency and offers the most efficient process.  Next Steps If the Council adopts the resolution, staff will inform required filers of the new process and procedures for electronic filing in early March and require electronic filing for the 2017 annual filing period . Training will be provided to new filers and the filer information will be retained electronically for future filings.  	\N	14
69	Update to Council on Community Choice Aggregation	Public Works, Office of Sustainability & Environment	Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) allows local governments to purchase and sell electricity to customers in their jurisdictions as an alternative to traditional investor owned utility (IOU) power procurement. Existing CCAs in other parts of California provide higher levels of renewable energy to their customers and offer lower prices than the IOUs that previously served them.  In order for Santa Monica to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 or sooner, sourcing electricity from renewable sources is an essential strategy. On January 31, 2015, Council adopted a non-binding resolution to join 12 cities from the South Bay and Westside, in what is collectively known as South Bay Clean Power (SBCP), in a study that would assess the feasibility of a subregional community choice aggregation (CCA). SBCP then approached the County of Los Angeles to fund the feasibility study of a countywide CCA. On June 30, 2016, the County of Los Angeles published a feasibility study and business plan to develop a countywide CCA. Both LA County and SBCP have convened advisory and stakeholder groups to discuss the pathways to initiating joint powers authority (JPA) agencies to establish CCAs . Staff are currently attending meetings of both groups to monitor their processes, but requires Council direction in order to fully participate in the JPA negotiations. Staff recommend that Council provide direction to staff to pursue one or more Community Choice Aggregation implementation pathways:  o pt to  join either the LA County or the SBCP JPA, explore initiating a CCA on its own , or choose not to participate in a CCA . Staff also recommend that Council adopt a resolution that affirms the city’s goals and objectives as a platform for negotiations and appoints representatives to participate in the LA County and SBCP JPA negotiations. 	On January 13, 2015, Council adopted a non-binding resolution to join 12 cities from the South Bay and Westside cities area in what is collectively known as South Bay Clean Power in a study that would assess the feasibility of a subregional CCA. After securing resolutions from 13 cities, South Bay Clean Power approached LA County to take the lead in financing the feasibility study for a countywide CCA.  On June 30, 2016 the County of Los Angeles published the feasibility study in the form of a Business Plan. The Business Plan determined that a CCA is feasible and could result in cost-savings for residential and commercial electricity customers.  On September 27, 2016 the LA County Board of Supervisors (LACBOS) passed a motion to authorize the Chief Executive Officer to engage stakeholders, determine the CCA governance structure and begin negotiations with eligible and interested cities. 	  Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) allows local governments to purchase and sell electricity to customers in their jurisdictions as an alternative to traditional investor owned utility (IOU) power procurement. Existing CCAs in other parts of California provide higher levels of renewable energy to their customers and offer lower prices than the IOUs that previously served them.  In order for Santa Monica to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 or sooner, sourcing electricity from renewable sources is an essential strategy. Santa Monica consumes over 900,000 MWh per year, with an approximate gross revenue value of $55 million. The LA County Business Plan concluded that the formation of a Los Angeles Community Choice Energy program (LACCE) is financially viable and would yield considerable benefits for the County’s residents and businesses, including: ·  Lower rates – The LACCE rate for 50% renewable energy could be 4% lower than the Southern California Edison (SCE) base rate for an energy mix that includes only 28% renewables. The LACCE rate with 100% renewables could be only 6% higher than SCE’s base rate. ·  Greenhouse Gas Reductions – At full implementation of LACCE, GHG emissions in Los Angeles County could be reduced by 7% at a 50% renewable content and by 14% at a 100% renewable content. ·  Economic development and jobs – LACCE could support the development of local and regional energy projects, creating local jobs. ·  Local Control and Energy Management – The County and cities would have the ability to offer choices for retail customers, like varying levels of renewable energy at different prices. Funding could be acquired for end-user programs such as energy efficiency, retail distributed generation, energy storage, water efficiency, and electric vehicle charging, etc. While this study was done specifically to develop the Los Angeles Community Choice Energy program, the similar benefits could be delivered to Santa Monica or a subregional CCA. Both LA County and South Bay Clean Power have convened stakeholder working groups to negotiate the governing structures and relationship between a County and subregional CCA. There are several options that the City could pursue to implement a CCA, each with pros and cons: 1.  Engage the Los Angeles Community Choice Energy program, and participate in Joint Powers Authority formation 2.  Engage the South Bay Clean Power subregional CCA program, and participate in Joint Powers Authority formation 3.  Independently seek to become a CCA as a City, and contract services for initiation from Lancaster Choice Energy, or a private third party The City could participate in stakeholder workshops and negotiations to form a Joint Powers Authority (JPA) agreement with the County and participating cities. Even once formed, there is no obligation to join LACCE should it not meet the City’s needs. As a member of the JPA, there would be no cost to the City for initial power procurement or program initiation costs or services. The City could have a seat on the LACCE JPA Board of Directors and would have the opportunity to work with the LACBOS and up to 81 other cities within the County. The County has initially proposed a voting structure that would give each city one vote, unless a board member calls for a weighted vote. The weighting of votes could be based on the electric power load of the members or some other weighting formula. Currently with the County and 37 interested cities as potential members, Santa Monica would have a weighted vote of 3.89%, ranking as the 6 th largest electrical consumer behind the County, Long Beach, Torrance, Carson, Santa Clarita and Industry.  Benefits of Joining LACCE ·  Los Angeles County has financial strength and human resources ·  The County has experience and expertise with running c ountywide programs ·  The County has the potential to be the largest CCA in California with 5 County districts and 82 eligible cities , and therefor e wield the greatest amount of purchasing power ·  The County would secure funding and services for all participating cities ·  The County would assume all of the risk associated with starting a CCA ·  There is strong support from County Supervisors and staff ·  The City of Santa Monica, as a South Bay Clean Power city, has been engaged in the CCA feasibility process for two years and is well positioned to influence the goals, mission, design, po licy, and procedures of the JPA  Potential D isadvantages of Joining LACCE ·  The County could move slowly due to size and miss important deadlines and milestone dates ·  The County has no prior experience with CCA and would rely on outside consultants that are also available to South Bay Clean Power cities and the City of Santa Monica ·  Because of the size and diversity of County cities, the JPA may not reflect the values and goals of the City of Santa Monica ·  There could be less local control and influence, working with such a large number of cities ·  The City would not receive any direct revenue from CCA operations The City could join a JPA with other interested South Bay and Westside cities and establish a subregional CCA. Each participating city would be represented with a seat on the JPA Board of Directors. SBCP would issue a Request for Services that includes all CCA funding and development costs with no cost to any individual city. The City, as a board member, would have the opportunity to determine and approve all goals and objectives of the program. SBCP has signaled that it would pursue an advanced CCA model that promotes maximizing local distributed energy resources (like rooftop solar) and the necessary build-out and job creation to do so. SBCP would hire an experienced Executive Director or CEO to run the CCA’s power authority and hire staff. SBCP would employ best practices from existing public power and regional power authorities. SBCP could collaborate as a subregional CCA with the LACCE to share economies of scale, but still retain autonomous decision-making. Currently with among the 14 interested cities, Santa Monica would have a 14% and 15% weighted vote by population and electric load, respectively.  Benefits of Joining SBCP ·  SBCP has access to the same funding and services as Los Angeles County ·  SBCP could collaborate and share economies of scale with the County without having a dedicated County seat on the LACCE Board of Directors ·  SBCP could have lowest possible rates due to a greater combined power load than the remaining power load of LACCE, Lancaster Clean Energy, or any other CCA in California ·  SBCP cities share common ground and would support new economic opportunities and environmental justice to frontline refinery communities. ·  SBCP is committed to CCA revenue going back into the program to maximize positive economic and environmental impacts ·  SBCP’s ability to be a statewide leader in the Distributed Energy Resources model is already embraced by state regulators and SCE ·  An existing strong and diverse coalition of stakeholders, political supporters, and endorsers provides advantages neither LACCE or LCE have ·  SBCP has over 2 years of Working Group experience and networking of CCA connections statewide and County-wide ·  With a much smaller membership the governance model for SBCP JPA would be simpler than that for LACCE, would provide the City of Santa Monica with a greater voice in decisions, and would serve as a model for other regional CCAs in the County to work together. Potential D isadvantages of Joining SBCP ·  There is the potential that SBCP cities could drop out and undermine the viability of the JPA ·  There could be disagreement on goals and objectives and inability to come to a JPA governance agreement ·  There is no proof of ability to achieve 50% renewables portfolio at a lower rate than SCE, as no feasibility study or business plan was developed specifically for SBCP ·  SBCP may have a challenge gathering enough community support and pa rticipation to achieve the high uptake rate that is required to be successful and competitive ·  SBCP may not be able to attract or retain a top quality Executive Director or CEO to run the CCA’s power authority ·  The County could oppose SBCP and refuse to collaborate ·  There could be less local control and influence, working with a smaller group of cities of whom some may have greater influence due to their weighted vote potential ·  The City would not receive any direct revenue from CCA operations Lancaster Choice Energy Service (LCE) has offered cities and counties its services to develop and launch CCAs. The City could pay LCE $154,000 in two phases to produce load forecasting, data analysis, and pro-forma development based on the city’s energy data. LCE would prepare an Ordinance of Intent to Form a CCA and Implementation Plan Document for the City. Once the CCA is operating, the City would pay a monthly fee for LCE Services. Council would have the ability to set the rates, determine the percentage of renewables, set the policy and program elements, do community outreach marketing, and have local governance and oversight. The City would be free to use revenue from the program for any General Fund purpose.  Benefits of Hiring LCE ·  Lancaster has experience operating the only CCA in Los Angeles County and SCE territory ·  The City would have sole control over the energy destiny without partnering with any other city or the County ·  The CCA could be branded as the City of Santa Monica’s alone, creating an opportunity to establish an integrated utility of water, waste management & electricity services ·  The City would have the ability to use revenue from the CCA to finance City projects of any kind ·  City Council and staff would have complete control of the program ·  No participation in a JPA would be required ·  The City would have access to Lancaster’s current and future renewable energy portfolio Potential D isadvantages of Hiring LCE ·  The up-front cost for development is not required by other options ·  The program would not be anchored by a JPA, which would place the City’s General Fund at risk if the CCA became insolvent ·  The cost for energy to consumers would likely be higher than other options as a smaller CCA ·  Lancaster is the State’s smallest CCA, less than two years old, and the only single city non-JPA CCA in California ·  There is no apparent value-added: all consultants and vendors that would provide key services are also available to cities, County, or SBCP directly without the LCE markup cost ·  LCE has no distributed energy focus , goals or commitment to building out local energy resources, jobs, job training, apprenticeship programs, or help for impacted and frontline communities CCAs can also be developed and implemented directly by third party service providers. Power services companies provide a broad array of expert services and are experienced in risk management and scheduling for public power agencies. They can still buy power from Power Marketers for the CCA, but have more options and flexibility; and they are agnostic as to what combination of wholesale power and local distributed energy best meet the CCA’s power needs. The City could issue a request for proposals to conduct a feasibility study, develop a business plan and select a service provider to initiate CCA services on behalf of the City, with no startup costs. The selected provider would provide these services and recoup its costs through the electrical rates. As no study has been performed at the City level, it is undetermined if this would be a cost-competitive offer compared to SCE, LACCE, SBCP or LCE. The City would be free to use revenue from the program for any General Fund purpose.  Benefits of Third Party Service Providers ·  Service providers will bear the risk of CCA formation ·  Service providers will have incentive to ensure the CCA is successful in order to recoup their capital costs ·  No participation in a JPA would be required ·  The City would have sole control over the energy services and programs without partnering with any other city or the County ·  The CCA could be branded as the City of Santa Monica’s alone, creating an opportunity to establish an integrated utility of water, waste management & electricity services ·  All CCA net revenues would be directed to the General Fund for community energy services ·  The City Council and staff would have complete direct control of the program Potential D isadvantages of Third Party Service Providers ·  The program would not be anchored by a JPA, which would place the City’s General Fund at risk if the CCA became insolvent ·  Additional City staff and resources would need to be dedicated to managing the CCA ·  The ongoing cost may not be as competitive as other options ·  There is only one precedent of a city-only CCA; Santa Monica would be a small CCA, and the second non-JPA CCA The City may participate in the LACCE JPA formation discussions with no obligation to participate in the actual JPA implementation. The LA County Chief Executive Officer will present the final draft LACCE JPA document to the LACBOS for approval. The LACCE JPA would be formed when at least one other city becomes a member. After which, Council would have to approve its participation in the LACCE. If the City does not join the JPA within a specified period, the City may risk having a smaller role in initiation and/or initiation costs that would not be applied to initial members.  The City may also participate in the SBCP JPA formation discussions with no obligation to participate in the actual JPA implementation. Once a final draft JPA is agreed upon by participating stakeholders, South Bay Clean Power will work with member cities to support its adoption and approval. A minimum number of cities and amount of electrical load will be required for the SBCP CCA to be successful, but that amount has not been determined.  Staff are currently attending meetings of both groups to monitor their processes, but require Council direction in order to fully participate in the JPA negotiations. In order to proceed, staff recommend that Council provide direction to staff to pursue one or more options of implementing a CCA. Staff also recommends Council adopt the attached resolution which would affirm Santa Monica’s goals and objectives as a platform for negotiations; and appoint a Council representative, staff liaison and alternate liaison to participate in formal negotiations.  On January 23, 2017, staff presented the Task Force on the Environment with an update on the City’s involvement to date in local  CCA activities. The Task Force on the Environment adopted a motion to support the City’s participation in both the LACCE and SBCP JPA formation discussions and recommends that Council adopt the draft platform of goals and objectives when entering negotiations: Draft Goals: ·  To eliminate carbon emissions associated with Santa Monica’s electricity generation sources by 2050 or sooner ·  To achieve the highest rate of renewable sources that are cost competitive ·  To increase the deployment of energy efficiency and demand response services, distributed energy resources, electric vehicle infrastructure and other clean technologies in Santa Monica and the Los Angeles metro area  Draft Objectives: ·  Implement or participate in a community choice energy/aggregation with goals and objectives that are aligned with Santa Monica’s goals and objectives ·  Seek to achieve the highest percentage of renewable energy from local sources and the highest level of participation in the community ·  Ensure that Santa Monica has voting representation that reflects its achievements in energy efficiency, solar and electric vehicles deployment, or population, instead of total electrical load ·  Ensure that Santa Monica will receive a sustainable and equitable source of funds that will support projects that reduce emissions from energy and fossil fuel use ·  Ensure that all Santa Monicans will have equitable and affordable access to clean energy and energy services 	\N	14

72	Update to the Water Shortage Response Plan	Public Works, Office of Sustainability & Environment	The City has in place a Water Shortage Response Plan (WSRP ) that requires water customers to meet a water use allowance (Allowance) whenever a Stage 1, 2, 3, or 4 w ater s upply s hortage is declared by City Council. Currently, the City is in a dec lared Stage 2 w ater s upply s hortage with allowances set a t 2 0% below a customer’s 2013 water consumption.  In January 2017, the 2016 California Green Building Standards went into effect lowering flow rates for new and/or retrofitted faucets and urinals. In addition, on May 9, 2017 Council adopted the water neutrality ordinance that requires a new development to consume no more water than the prior use . As a result, the new development is required to calculate the new water demand.  Staff is recommending an update to the WSRP (Attachment B ) that would establish  the new development’s approved new water demand as the Allowance during a declared water supply shortage and change the plumbing fixture flow rates to match the current State Building Code requirements. 	Between 2007 and early 2017, with the exception of 2011-12, California was in a record drought. The drought resulted in the lowest rainfall and snowpack since 1896.  On  May 27, 2008 ,  Council adopted amendments to SMMC 7.16 - Water Conservation, which gave Council the authority to determine and declare a water supply shortage and to adopt a WSRP (Attachment C ) . The WSRP was developed in 2009 to comply with the State’s Urban Water Management Plan requirements and was based on the California Department of Water Resources 2007 Urban Drought Guidebook.   On June 9, 2009, Council adopted the WSRP (Attachment D ) . The WSRP was included in the City’s 2010 Urban Water Management Plan, which was subsequently approved by the State.  The WSRP mandates that when Stage 1, 2, 3, or 4 water supply shortage is declared, A llowances go into effect. This mandatory conservation requires water customers to reduce use by a set percentage from a prior year’s water usage. T he City is currently in a Stage 2 w ater s upply s hortage and A llowances are in effect that are 2 0% below the customer’s 2013 water usage . Water customers that exceed their A llowance are subject to fines and civil penalties. Adjustments to the A llowance may be granted if certain criteria including water-saving plumbing fixtures are installed.  Also on June 9, 2009 , Council declared a Water Shortage Advisory calling for a voluntary 10 % reduction in water u se in response to the drought.  The Water Shortage Advisory remained in place as part of the effort to reduce the need to import water from MWD and reach the City’s goal for water self-sufficiency by 2020. In response to the continuing drought, o n January 29, 2014, the City increased its voluntary conservation target from 10% to 20% (Attachment E ) .  On August 12, 2014 , Council adopted a resolution , per Attachment F , declaring a Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage , which changed the voluntary 20% conservation target to a mandatory 20% reduction  in water use . It also directed staff to return with a detailed Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage implementation plan including proposed amendments to Section 7.16 of the Municipal Code and the WSRP, a financial impact analysis to address revenue reductions , additional staffing and program implementation costs, and an implementation timeline.  On October 28, 2014 , staff returned to Council and presented proposed updates to the WSRP (Attachment G ) as well as information about proposed changes to the Municipal Code and implementation of water shortage response measures.  Council provided feedback and directed staff to return with proposed changes to the WSRP that included input from the public, a Water Conservation Unit within the Office of Sustainability and the Environment to implement the Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage, and return with proposed changes to the Municipal Code that related to water conservation.  On January 13, 2015, Council re-affirmed and re- declared a Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage and adopted updates to the WSRP (Attachment H ).  This included Allowances for all water customers set at 80% of their 2013 water usage for Stage 2; established penalties for exceedance of Allowances ; established residential water conservation thresholds for single family and multi-family residential customers; and provided a process for adjustment of a n Allowance.  On September 8, 2015, Council adopted an update to the W SRP  (Attachment I ) . The major updates were to modify the penalty fee structure for exceeding the A llowance and to provide for waiving of the first exceedance penalty by participating in a City- offered water school.  On January 1, 2017, the current California Green Building Standards went into effect in Santa Monica lowering the flow rates for plumbing fixtures including urinals and faucets. The WSRP includes specific flow rates for plumbing fixtures that must be installed in order to receive a water use allowance adjustment.  On May 9, 2017, Council adopted the water neutrality ordinance (Attachment J) that requires new developments to use no more water than the current usage. As a result, a developer is required to calculate the projected water demand for their proposed new development . 	 The WSRP is a roadmap developed in response to impending and ongoing water supply shortages. It is updated at least every five  years as part of the State required Urban Water Management Plan. There are five stages (Advisory and Stage 1 to 4) of water supply shortages within the WSRP and actions range from voluntary to mandatory water conservation. The mandatory conservation requirements are implemented through Allowances assigned to water customers. Water customers are required to reduce their usage by a set percentage depending on the current stage of water supply shortage.  Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4 % Water Available per Customer  85%  80%  70%  50%     In response to the unprecedented drought and its ongoing effects on Santa Monica’s water supply, the City remains in a Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage that requires a 20% reduction in water use from 2013 levels . Local groundwater provides about 75% of the City’s water supply, which have yet to recover fully,  even with the recent record-breaking rains . T he natural process by which this occurs takes time and it may be a few years, along with more wet winters, for local groundwater suppl ies to return to pre-drought conditions. In order to be at least as effective as the current California Green Building Standards, the WSRP must be updated to reflect new requirements for plumbing fixture flow rates. This includes lower flows for urinals and faucets.  As part of the recently adopted water neutrality ordinance, developers are required to calculate the projected water demand for the project. For the purpose of the water neutrality ordinance, n ew developments are defined as :  new buildings with plumbing fixtures; existing buildings with plumbing fixtures where 50% or more of the exterior walls or major support structures are demolished; and /or new or enlarged pools, spas, water features, and ponds. If the calculated water demand from the proposed new development is greater than the amount the property currently uses (using a five-year average), then the developer must attempt to design a more water-efficient property through fixtures and systems ( e.g. graywater and rain water harvesting). If the new development is still projected to use more water after all practical water- saving devices and systems are included in the design, then an in-lieu fee is required. Those fees pay to retrofit existing off-site buildings with water-saving fixtures to offset the additional water demand of the new development .  Once approved , the calculated water demand for the new development would be used as the Allowance for the property during a declared water supply shortage provid ing a realistic yet water- conserving  target . Currently, Allowances are a 20% reduction from usage in 2013.  N ew developments that calculate greater water use than the current property’ s five- year average would not likely meet Allowances as defined and , subsequently, could be fined for exceedances . This would trigger  requests for adjustments to their A llowance s. These adjustment requests would be granted because the development s would be built to the current water-efficient building requirements , which i s a pre-requisite for an adjustment.  Setting the new development’s  Allowance as the calculated and approved water demand provides the most accurate water budget and would lead to fewer exceedance citations issued and fewer adjustment requests. Requiring the  Allowance to equal the approved new water demand will encourage designer(s) of new developments to produce accurate estimations to help their clients avoid A llowance exceedance penalties. The Allowance would be updated after the certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy is issued. This proposed update to the Allowance would not apply to new or enlarged pools, spas, water features, and ponds.  Outreach Five Water Neutrality Stakeholder Committee meetings were held on November 15, 2016, December 12, 2016, January 24, 2016, March 8,  2017, and April 4, 2017, where proposed requirements of the ordinance and its implementation were discussed and a consensus on recommendations was achieved . Stakeholder Committee members include representatives from water agencies, non-governmental organizations, sustainability consultants, architects, developers, manufacturers, engineers, plumbers, Los Angeles County; the City’s Water Advisory Committee , including residents ; and staff from the Public Works Department, Planning and Community Development Department, and the City Attorney’s Office .   Staff also presented this information to the Chamber of Commerce Governmental Affairs Committee on March 6, 2017. A public meeting was held on April 6, 2017 and 10 community members attended. A presentation was made to the North of Montana Association ( NOMA ) neighborhood association on April 6, 2017  and at the Mid-Cities neighborhood association on April 18, 2017 . The public was notified by emails sent to all the neighborhood groups and business districts; Facebook postings, a press release, and calendar event listed on the City’s website. Information about the ordinance and how to comply with it will be posted on the City’s website. The proper notices were included in the Santa Monica Daily press and made available in the City Clerk’s Office in accordance with noticing requirements.  Water Advisory Committee Presentation took place on February 6, 2017 and the recommendation was in support of the ordinance.  Task Force on the Environment Presentation took place on March 20, 2017 and the motion was made in support of the ordinance.  Alternatives The current process for Allowances would remain in place if this update is not approved. New developments would be required to reduce 20% from the 2013 water usage or default baseline or comply with a threshold if it is a single-family or multi-family customer. 	\N	15
73	Financial Status Update, FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget, and FY 2017-18 Proposed CIP Budget	Finance Department, Budget Division	This report presents the City of Santa Monica’s FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget and Capital Improvement Program Budget for FY 2017-18, as well as the May 2017 Financial Status Update (Update) for the General Fund for Fiscal Years 2017-18 through FY 2021-22.  The Update includes the numbers set forth in the Proposed Budget as well as new information received since the Five-Year Financial Forecast was presented to Council on January 24, 2017 .  The FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget (Attachment A) is balanced, with resources dedicated to maintaining the City’s core services and allocating new and repurposed funding to programs t hat reflect Council priorities. Given the certainty that pension costs will rise sharply beginning in FY 2018-19 and the uncertainty about our national economy in future years, this budget lives within our means and begins the long-term reduction of our staffing levels to maintain Santa Monica’s fiscal health and sustainability. While there is a slight increase in p ermanent staff in the General F und to address emerging issues such as cybersecurity, reductions in staff in non-general funds mean a decrease of 3.8 FTE positions overall.  This budget incorporates an evolving new “Framework” that will ultimately link the results the City seeks to accomplish with the funding needed to achieve those results and the approach the City will take to measur e performance.  The Proposed Biennial Budget is $773.7 million in FY 2017-18 and $802.1 million in FY 2018-19.  The significant increase is due to the inclusion of capital improvement projects funded using reserves and bond proceeds.  The May 2017 General Fund Financial Status Update includes the FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget numbers in its projection of the City’s future budget climate.  The Update shows two years of positive General Fund structural balances before an anticipated deficit of approximately $3.8 million in FY 2019-20 that increases to almost $19 million (3.7% of the General Fund budget) in FY 2021-22.   The projected deficits are due primarily to increases in pension costs.  The financial status of other funds remains relatively stable.  However, the Housing Authority Fund is projected to require subsidies through the end of the forecast period.  The Pier Fund is also projected to require subsidies as the combination of operating and large capital expenditures are outpacing the growth of revenues during the forecast period.  Also presented in this report are the results of a citywide Fee Study (Attachment D) conducted to calculate the City’s cost of providing various services that benefit individual users of the service rather than all members of the community, and to identify changes to the current fee structure to ensure that the City is recovering an appropriate share of these costs through user fees. 	On January 24, 2017 Council reviewed the Five-Year Financial Forecast  for the period FY  2017-18 through FY  2021-22  (Attachment B) .  The Forecast’s best, probable , and worst case scenarios provided a range of impacts that the General Fund could be required to withstand.  In the probable scenario, General Fund expenditures would slightly exceed projected revenues as early as FY 2017-18 and the structural deficit would rea ch $16.4 million by FY 2021-22. 	  Economic Update The U.S. economy continues to grow, but at a mild pace. Economic growth as measured by GDP was positive in 2016 for the seventh consecutive year, one of the longest economic recoveries on record but also one of the weakest.  Economic growth has averaged just 2.1% annually during the post-recession period and most economists are projecting continued modest growth (2-2.5% range annually) over the 2017-2019 time period.  Unemployment is at its lowest level in ten years.  The housing market remains strong and inflation continues to be low.  The Federal Reserve has begun to increase interest rates and is expected to continue these increases over the next two years in an effort to “normalize” rates .  However, the economy is not without risks.  The policy impacts of the new administration in Washington cannot yet be determined.  Also, history would indicate that the economy is likely to head into a recession somet ime within the next five years.  The State economy recovered strongly from the “Great Recession.”  Growth in household incomes is exceeding the national average.  However, during that time, the State budget has also expanded in an attempt to correct long term issues.  However, after several years of strong growth, State revenues are beginning to fall short of projections.  According to the Governor’s FY 2017-18 Proposed Budget, an operating deficit of nearly $2 billion will occur next fiscal year with on-going deficits in the same range in the future unless corrective action is taken.  While the budget does propose corrective actions, the possibility of a recession in the next few years poses additional significant risks to the State Budget.  Santa Monica’s economy remains relatively strong due in large part to its geographic location and its diversified tax revenue base.  However, there are signs of moderation in the local economy’s growth rate.  General Fund revenue growth has begun to slow after several years of strong increases.  Average annual growth the last three years has been 3.2% following growth rates of over 8% in the three years of recovery following the recession.  Also, as with the State and national economies, the threat of a recession could significantly alter revenue projections.  More information on some of the City’s key revenue sources is provided below.  Property values in the City remain the third highest in Los Angeles County for a City with the 19th largest population.  The FY 2016-17 assessed value increase was 6.5% after a 6% gain the previous year.  Moderate increases of 3-4% are projec ted over the next five years.  Sales tax growth rates are expected to be modest, reflecting the loss of several large tax generators and the shifting of retail activity to on-line sales.  City taxable sales are projected to grow by 3% in FY 2017-18 and another 3.6% in FY 2018-19.  The additional half percent TUT tax approved by voters in November 2016, Measure GSH, will not remain in the General Fund as it will pass through to affordable housing uses and the School District.  Tourism, which provides a major stimulus to the local economy by creating jobs and producing revenues, continues to show strength.  Transient Occupancy Taxes have increased at an average annual rate of 9.3% over the last six years, and revenues are expected to continue having healthy increases over the forecast period, reflecting the recent opening of two new hotels and another one that is under construction and anticipated to open within the next three years.  One area of uncertainty over the forecast period is the impact of new registration requirements fo r home share hosting platforms.  Business License Taxes are expected to show some weakness in FY  2017 ‑ 18, reflecting the loss of several of the largest taxpayers due to relocations, before resuming a moderate growth rate of just under 3% for the remainder of the forecast period.  Utility Users Tax revenues are declining slightly in FY 2017-18 and then staying flat over the forecast period as revenues from telecommunication services continue to drop.  Parking Facility Taxes are expected to grow by approximately 2% per year over the forecast period.  And interest rates, which fell to historically low levels over the last seven years, significantly impacting the City’s investment income, have begun to increase.  While a gradual increase is expected over the forecast period, rates are still expected to remain at relatively low levels.  General Fund Financial Status Update The May General Fund Financial Status Update reflects revised revenue projections as well as proposed operating and capital budget recommendations included in the Proposed Budget.  Assumptions related to retirement contributions and healthcare costs remain unchan g ed since the January forecast.  Staff has completed three forecast scenarios that contemplate Best, Probable , and Worst Case impacts on the General Fund.  The chart below shows the three forecast scenarios.  The Probable scenario, which serves as the baseline for the forecast, shows the General Fund experiencing a potential shortfall of approximately $3.8 million in FY  2019-20 that increases to almost $19 million (3.7% of the General Fund budget) in FY 2021-22.  The major challenges to the City’s budget continue to be pension, health insurance and workers’ compensation costs.  T he incremental lowering of the rate used by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) to forecast the growth of its investments from 7.5% to 7.0% over three years beginning in FY 2018-19 will result in up to 23% increases in pension contribution rates within five years.  This translates to an increase of approximately $2.0 million to General Fund retirement costs in FY 2018-19 that increase to almost $13 million in FY 2021-22, 70% of the deficit amount.  Also negatively impacting the fund balance are the continued 8% annual increases in health insurance premiums and 10% annual increases in workers’ compensation costs that far exceed the 2.7% average annual growth rate of revenues.  In the Best Case scenario, bolstered by higher increases in revenues, the General Fund would experience a potential shortfall of approximately $1.2 million in FY 2020-21 that increases to $8.3 million in FY 2021-22.  In the Worst Case scenario, which shows the effects of a possible recession, the General Fund would experience a shortfall of $4.3 million in FY 2017-18 that would increase significantly to $27.5 million in FY  2021 ‑ 22.  Other Fund Status Other major funds that are included in the Financial Status Update fall into two categories: 1) funds that operate with sufficient revenues to sustain necessary operating capital needs, and 2) funds that have a structural deficit where ongoing revenues are not sufficient to cover ongoing expenditures.  Self-Sustaining Enterprise Funds The Water and Wastewater Funds have sufficient revenues to cover current operations.  Rate increases in the Water Fund allow the implementation of the Sustainable Water Master Plan while also maintaining reserve levels.  The Wastewater Fund continues to have adequate revenues and reserves to meet current operational and capital expenditures.  The Resource Recovery and Recycling (RRR) Fund will maintain a positive fund balance until FY  2019-20.  There are several upcoming proposals that may potentially have a substantial impact on the financial stability of the fund after FY 2019-20, including the piloting of a residential wet/dry collection system, expanding the commercial “rot or not” program, the Fund’s share of costs to complete the Corporate Yards modernization project, and the displacement of the recycling contractor at the Corporate Yards that will result in additional costs for transporting the City-collected recycling materials to an offsite location.  Staff will continue to monitor fund performance and consider the need for a rate increase in the future.  The BBB Fund will also maintain a positive fund balance over the next five years.  BBB, like most transit agencies in the country, continues to be confronted with reduced ridership, and BBB staff continues to develop strategies to improve ridership.  The fund will receive additional revenue from the new voter-approved Measure M, which allocates an additional ½ cent sales tax to agencies in order to improve traffic congestion, keep transit fares affordable and improve bus systems.  The Airport, Beach and Cemetery Funds will generate adequate revenues to sustain their operations throughout the next five years.  Funds Requiring General Fund Subsidies The Housing Authority Fund has a projected operating structural deficit of approximately $0.5  million to $1 million annually throughout the forecast period. This assumes that U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding to housing authorities will not be reduced.  The Pier Fund  is not able to sustain an adequate balance to cover both its operating costs and large capital expenditures.  Capital needs that are unable to be funded by the Pier Fund during the forecast period must compete with General Fund-supported capital needs.  FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget The Proposed Biennial Budget for the City of Santa Monica is balanced and totals $773.7 million in FY 2017-18 and $802.1 million in FY 2018-19.  The FY 2017-18 Proposed Budget is $118 million , or 18% , higher than the FY  2016-17 Revised Budget due to increased capital spending.  The largest component of the budget is the General Fund, where most municipal services are funded.  The proposed General Fund budget is $504.9 million in FY  2017 ‑ 18 and $530.5 million in FY 2018-19.  FY 2017-18 General Fund expenditures increase $121.1 million or 32% over the FY 2016-17 Revised Budget due to the inclusion of capital improvement projects funded using reserves and bond proceeds.  FY  2018-19 expenditures increase $25.6 million , or 5% , over the FY 2017-18 Proposed Budget.  As fiscal challenges continue, it is imperative for the City to be purposeful, watchful, and strategic about how funds are spent.  The FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget incorporates a new Framework that provides the structure for an overarching program to state core values, establish objectives, and measure progress made on those objectives.  The Framework, which c aptures work on strategic goals as well as departmental and citywide programs, policies and projects, is built on the City’s long-term commitment to sustainability and its new Wellbeing Index.  It begins the City’s shift towards a unified performance management system called SaMoStat.  The Framework is a living tool that will evolve as staff, with community input, targets services, policy initiatives and projects that will help move the dial on key outcomes and then develops metrics to monitor progress in meeting these outcomes.  In the future, staff will collect and analyze relevant data and will use this Framework to make resource and programmatic decisions, and to address operational challenges, including how to most effectively meet needs for services using increasingly limited resources.  In addition to the new Framework, the City has taken steps to control costs in the FY  2017-19 Proposed Budget and beyond by reallocating over $4 million in General Fund budget to areas requiring additional focus, rather than adding resources.  Among the new or augmented items staff is proposing to fund in the General Fund operating budget are: ·  Ongoing funding to ensure Tongva and Palisades Parks remain safe and welcoming for all users by employing on-site DTSM Ambassadors to greet patrons, monitor the Tongva Park public restrooms, and report maintenance problems to City maintenance staff and illegal activity to public safety officers, along with maintenance funding for the new Ishihara Park.  ·  Two new attorney positions, supported in part by increased revenue recovery, in the Criminal and Code Enforcement areas to accommodate a large increase in workload for the City Attorney’s Office due primarily to changes in state law that converted certain felonies to misdemeanor crimes, an uptick of activity relating to EXPO, and additional code enforcement caseload related to tenant protection, short term rentals, and more administrative citations.  ·  In our internal services departments, additional funds for technology training, in addition to four new positions addressing high cost/high risk areas, based on recent independent assessments.  Besides cyber and data security, these include benefits billing audits and reconciliation, as well as procurement solicitations and negotiations.  We anticipate that these positions will generate offsetti ng savings and/or limit losses.  ·  Staffing adjustments to increase permit processing and customer service, integrating review of tenant impacts of construction projects.  With training and support by the City Attorney’s Office, Code Enforcement staff is also assuming additional responsibilities for tenant harassment enforcement to augment and expand existing enforcement efforts by the C ity Attorney’s Office.  ·  Childcare subsidies, provided through Connections for Children, for an additional 10  participants.  Subsidies benefit low and moderate income Santa Monica families with c hildren up to kindergarten age.  ·  To increase the diversity of our Fire personnel, and provide career opportunities and valuable training for local youth interesting in pursuing a career in the fire service, staff is implementing a Fire Cadet program.  Staff is also creating a Management Fellowship Program as a cost-effective app roach to recruiting new talent.  In other funds, staff proposes funding to implement the Water Neutrality Ordinance, as well as the extension of limited term water conservation staff while the City continues to work towards water self-sufficiency by 2020.  Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Budget On June 14, 2016 (Attachment C), Council adopted the first year and approved the second year of the FY 2016-18 Biennial Capital Improvement Program Budget.  The changes outlined in the CIP Addendum portion of the Proposed Budget are revisions to the second year of the approved Biennial Budget, FY 2017-18.  These changes are limited to needs that have risen during the first year of the Biennial Budget and cannot be deferred until the next biennial budget process. The revised FY 2017-18 CIP Budget totals $238.8 million.  This represents an increase of $117.2 million from the originally proposed FY 2017-18 CIP Budget and an increase of $125.1 million over the FY 2016-17 Adopted Budget of $113.7 million.  The total CIP Budget, including the General Fund portion, is higher than typical due to use of one-time reserves, bond financing, and settlement funds for specific projects noted below.  Budget changes are outlined in detail in the CIP Addendum section of the FY 2017-19 Proposed B iennial Budget (Attachment A).  General Fund CIP Budget Changes Of the total FY 2017-18 CIP budget, the General Fund portion represents $145.7 million or 61%.  The Proposed CIP Budget includes approximately $76.6 million in General Fund budget increases for the FY 2017-18 Exception Based CIP Budget that are funded using bond proceeds, project deferrals and released budget from cancelled projects.  The revised FY 2017-18 CIP budget is significantly higher than the originally proposed CIP budget due to updated plans regarding the financing of the City Services Building.  The FY 2016-18 CIP Adopted Biennial Budget assumed that lease revenue bonds would be issued to finance this project in FY 2018-19.  This assumption was revised and the FY  2017-18 CIP Budget now includes $76.8 million in bond proceeds.  In addition, there are $3.6 million in other recommended General Fund budget increases that are completely offset by a total of $3.8 million in budget reductions, resulting in a net decrease of $0.2 million.  New or augmented General Fund projects cover $0.5 million in public safety projects, including Mobile Data Computer Replacement and Fire Particulate Exhaust Removal System; $2.2 million in Mobility/Parking projects, including Streetlight Installation, Structural Repairs to Parking Structures 1 and 3, and Bollards in Parking Structure 5; and $0.6 million in priority General Government projects, including Fire Department Tenant Improvements.  In addition, $0.4 million is allocated to Percent for Art s for the new Fire Station 1.  Projects deferred from the FY 2017-18 Budget Plan include Streetscape Planning and construction of the 17th Street/SMC/Expo Bike Path Connection project .   The deferred projects will be budgeted in the FY 2018-20 CIP Biennial Budget.  Lastly, $0.75 million in Broadband for Affordable Housing Buildings previously budgeted in the General Fund is now funded by Community D evelopment Block Grant funding.  Non-General Fund Budget Changes The total net increase proposed for Non-General Fund budgets is approximately $40.9  million.  A significant portion of the Non-General Fund budget increase is due to budget appropriations for affordable housing that total $19.5 million.  These funds are comprised of redevelopment-related loan repayments and settlement payments that are being set-aside for affordable housing development.  The FY 2017-18 budget also includes an increase of $14.5 million to maintain or improve water, wastewater , and stormwater runoff infrastructure, including the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP), Water Main Replacement project, the Clean Beaches Project, and drainage improvements.  The remaining significant Non-General Fund increases are from an appropriation of $2.9 million in Transportation Impact Fee Revenues for Lincoln Blvd.  Streetscape Improvements and $1.8 million in the Airport Fund toward the airport runway reduction project.  Pier Fund projects were adjusted to accommodate the most updated priorities for Pier infrastructure maintenance, and budget increases in the Internal Service funds will accommodate increasing technology needs and new vehicle management technology.  All but one of the proposed budget increases can be fully supported by an existing enterprise fund balance or special revenue source; the Pier Fund will require a General Fund subsidy of $1.4 million to fund capital needs in FY 2017-18.  That amount is deducted from the annual General Fund CIP allocation, and as such, Pier Fund projects are considered in conjunction with General Fund proje cts during the budget process.  Citywide Fee Study Since 1988, Council has directed staff to periodically conduct studies to calculate the City’s cost of providing various services that benefit individual users of the service rather than members of the community, and to determine if the City is recovering an appropriate share of these costs through user fees.  It is City policy to achieve full cost recovery for these services, with some exceptions.  The Community & Cultural Services Department (CCS) fees, which average 32% cost recovery, are based on a pricing policy that reflects Council priorities for community recreation and social services benefits.  At this time, staff is proposing no changes to CCS fees (with the exception of the Beach House) because following the adoption of the FY 2017-19 budget, staff will conduct a thorough analysis of CREST and Community Recreation program fees in order to develop proposed fee adjustments with an appropriate strategy for community stakeholder engagement.  Animal Control fees are also less than cost covering as cities traditionally subsidize these services to encourage licensing spaying/neutering.  Some other fees are recommended for less than full cost recovery due to previous Council direction or statutory limits.  A recent study prepared by MGT of America analyzed the cost of services in the Planning and Community Development, Public Works, Police, Fire, Community and Cultural Services, the Records and Election Services Departments as well as the Library.  Zoning ordinance fees were not included in the study as they were recently reviewed and updated in coordination with the Zoning Code update in 2015.   Based on the study, which included the analysis of approximately 635 fees, staff recommends creating 40 new user fees and 2 new fines/penalty charges . Twenty nine of the new items are in the General Fund, increasing most fees to an appropriate level of cost recovery, reducing 89 fees, and eliminating 43 fees.  Staff anticipates implementation of the fee study recommendations will result in approximately $1.4  million in additional annual revenue, $1 million o f which is in the General Fund.  Attachment D (Fee Study Report) provides a summary of the results of the fee study, as well as the consultant’s report.  Staff will return to Council with any necessary implementing ordinances and resolutions at the time of Budget Adoption.  Beach Parking Rate Increase Parking revenues account for 75% of Beach Fund revenue.  Beach Parking rates were last increased in November 2012.  Staff is recommending a moderate increase in beach parking rates to continue to provide the high quality of maintenance and services to the more than 17 million visitors to Santa Monica Beach each year, and to fully fund the long awaited capital improvements to the Beach Trail. The increase also recognizes the higher fees charged at adjacent County beaches in Venice and the Pacific Palisades as shown in the chart below:  Location Winter Summer  Weekday Weekend Weekday Weekend Venice $6 $9 $9 $18 Will Rogers $6 $9 $9 $15 Dockweiler $6 $8 $8 $13 Point Dume $6 $8 $8 $14 Zuma $6 $8 $8 $10 Marina del Rey $6 $8 $10 $15  The chart below shows the current and proposed rates for the beach lots:  Central Beach South Beach North Beach  Current Proposed Current Proposed Current Proposed Summer Weekday $12 $14 $8 $10 $8 $10 Summer Weekend $12 $14 $10 $12 $10 $12 Winter Weekday $6 $7 $6 $7 $6 $7 Winter Weekend $8 $10 $8 $10 $8 $10 Short-Term $1 per hr No change $1 per hr No change NA NA  No changes are recommended for the Pier parking lot or the Annenberg Community Beach House lot at this time.  The rate increase maintains the pricing policy that keeps prices higher in lots closest to the Pier and lower in the lots to the north and south, as a way to spread demand to match parking supply.  Monthly and annual permit fees, as well as event rental rates, will be reviewed in a future comprehensive study of citywide parking rates that is expected to be initiated in the next year.  The proposed rate increase is expected to generate an additional $1.7 million annually; $1 million for FY 2017-18 since the rate increase is not effective until November 2017.  The rate increase will ensure that sufficient funds are available for construction of the North Beach Trail Improvements in 2018, cover ongoing operations, and build up the Beach Fund balance to support additional capital needs in the future.  Next Steps Council will convene a public hearing on June 27, 2017 to consider, receive public comment, make revisions to, and adopt the first year and approve the second year of the Biennial Budget, as well as to adopt the second year of the Capital Improvement Program Biennial Budget.  Members of the public may provide comments on the Proposed Budget by sending an email to councilmtgitems@smgov.net or by giving public testimony at the May 23 and May 24 study sessions and Budget Adoption hearing on June 27, 2017.

76	The Final Public Hearing Draft Downtown Community Plan and Associated Amendments to the Land use and Circulation Element, Civic Center Specific Plan, Zoning Ordinance, SMMC Chapter 9.53 and SMMC Article 8.	Development Services (PCD)	\N	The Downtown Community Plan is a roadmap guiding the evolution of Downtown Santa Monica, a 229-acre area identified by the City’s Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) as bounded by Wilshire Boulevard and the I-10 Freeway, and between Lincoln Boulevard and Ocean Avenue. Taking into account that only 4% of the City lies within Downtown (roughly half a square mile), the DCP lays out a framework that integrates housing, jobs, mobility, historic preservation, public open space, infrastructure, and art and culture into a comprehensive long-term Plan. When adopted, the DCP will guide decision-makers and City departments, property owners and developers, as well as local stakeholder groups who provide services and programs to benefit the health and vitality of Downtown Santa Monica and all those who live, work or play here. Creation of the DCP The path that the DCP has taken to get to this final phase began with the adoption of the LUCE in 2010.  The LUCE set forth goals and policies for an expanded Downtown and called for a Specific Plan (the DCP) to propose strategies and standards to create the conditions for a sustainable urban lifestyle. This vision included expanding cultural arts offerings, and adding both intimate and larger open spaces to the growing residential community. The vision addressed traffic, congestion and pedestrian safety by suggesting upgrades to streetscapes, optimizing the circulation network and integrating the Expo Light Rail into the physical fabric of the community in order meet the needs of all people navigating the Downtown. Priority was assigned to public improvements that would enhance the pedestrian experience and to standards and programs that would foster trip reduction by encouraging transit, walking, and biking as well as Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures.  The planning effort has been guided by substantial community participation and the involvement of the City’s Boards and Commissions, including the City Council.  Throughout the workshops and discussions, public hearings and events, stakeholders have worked assiduously to shape the DCP into a balanced framework that supports residents, business owners, employees, non-profits, property owners and other community stakeholders.  Since initiating the planning process in 2012, several iterations of the DCP have been introduced, including:  ·  September 2013: Downtown Specific Plan Framework . This document included a compilation of the primary components of the Plan including all of the issues that had been discussed to that date. The Framework became the basis of a project description for the Program Environmental Impact Report. ·  February 2014: Draft Downtown Specific Plan . The first release of a comprehensive Downtown Specific Plan came a year later, adding greater detail to the concepts included in the Framework, and weaving together regulatory proposals with policy. The Draft Downtown Specific Plan underwent a major revision and restructuring process in winter 2016. ·  February 2016: Draft Downtown Community Plan . The second full-length version of the Plan was released in February 2016 under a new title of “Downtown Community Plan.” This effort was conducted to recognize the overarching desire to nurture a long-term community within Downtown’s boundaries, and to make sure that every Santa Monica resident feels welcome in the Downtown. The revision included an overhaul of the document that resulted in reformatting, reorganization, and text streamlining.  The Plan was also made more action-oriented, tying key initiatives to phasing periods and responsible parties both within and outside City government. ·  April 2017: Final Public Hearing Draft Downtown Community Plan . The final Public Hearing version of the Plan was released on April 12 th at a public event at the Civic Center’s East Wing.  This updated edition comes on the heels of a full year of extended community outreach, and includes several substantial changes from the 2016 text.  Over the course of April and May of 2017, the Planning Commission provided comments and recommended changes, which are enumerated in the Addenda (Attachment B).  Throughout the various versions of the DCP, the City Council and Boards and Commissions have provided continuous feedback to further refine the Plan’s core tenets and to provide detail in areas where specificity strengthened standards, policies or actions.  The City Council (February 28,2012, July 9, 2013 and October 13, 2015) and Planning Commission (March 16, 2011, January 11, 2012, March 28, 2012, July 11, 2012, December 5, 2012, January 23, 2013, March 6, 2013, July 17, 2013, August 7, 2013, November 2, 2013, November 3, 2015, March 2, 2016, March 3, 2016, November 16, 2016, December 7, 2016, April 25, 2017, May 10, 2017, May 11, 2017, May 17, 2017, May 18, 2017, May 31, 2017 ) have held public hearings and provided significant input into the planning process, shaping the concepts and strategies over the last 5 years.  Throughout the planning period, the planning team’s communication approach has been fluid to integrate as many perspectives as possible through a variety of means.  These include public workshops, focus groups, presentations to neighborhood organizations, online surveys, a dedicated interactive project website www.downtownsmplan.org and a variety of fun events such as walking tours, farmer’s market exhibitions and community celebrations for major milestones.  Below is a list of meetings and events that have been conducted with the participation of several thousand people. 	  The Final Downtown Community Plan (Attachment A) presents a vision for Downtown Santa Monica that includes a prioritization for over 2,500 new housing units, as well as new public spaces, a further diversification of art and cultural offerings, a prominent role for historic preservation, and a multi-faceted approach to enhancing Downtown’s pedestrian environment through building setbacks and improved streetscapes, to name but a few.  Designed to be a relatively lower-scale 5-7 story Downtown, the DCP envisions that change will happen incrementally and be accompanied by infrastructure investments, including enhancements to the mobility network, that support the needs of a growing population.  Refining the LUCE Vision The 2010 LUCE defined newly expanded boundaries for Downtown.  The LUCE brought in all areas west of Lincoln Boulevard into the planning boundary to increase Downtown’s footprint and to concentrate desired housing, jobs and community-serving uses near the terminus of the Expo light rail.  Noting the inherent challenges faced by Downtown to maintain Santa Monica’s small-town vibrancy and flavor, the LUCE directed the City and community to develop a Specific Plan “to determine the appropriate range of building heights in the district and address the need for open space, affordable and workforce housing, pedestrian access from areas south of the Downtown core, the linkages from Downtown to the Beach and the incorporation of the Downtown Light Rail Station into the fabric of the Downtown. (LUCE Policy D14.1)” After six years of Plan development, outreach and public discussions, the DCP has struck a balance to meet the challenges identified in the LUCE. The DCP creates the conditions for a lively pedestrian-oriented mix of uses and activities, including new housing options that are complemented by services and public spaces to create a complete neighborhood. It further strengthens Downtown’s identity by safeguarding City designated historic resources and potential historic resources through a comprehensive preservation approach, and marries this to the creation of “new landmarks” that will spring from flexible development standards that inspire creativity and innovation at a scale that is consistent with Santa Monica’s contemporary urban form. Lastly, the DCP continues to rely on the concept that pedestrians come first in Downtown Santa Monica. Addressing the full range of mobility in the Downtown relies on building on the investments already in place and strategic investment in infrastructure and programs to the meet the transportation needs of Downtown.  As a comprehensive document, the DCP provides substantial policy guidance on all of the elements mentioned above, such that the Council and its Boards and Commissions will have a framework for making decisions about public investments, or judging the merit of proposals that are submitted by private individuals who wish to effect any manner of change Downtown.  Significantly, the DCP also provides a suite of actions that the City itself will use to develop departmental and interagency workplans around infrastructure upgrades, public space enhancement, economic development, historic preservation, and mobility. These actions, implemented in coordination with a monitoring program that includes a cap on the volume of development evaluated under the Plan’s EIR, will guide city leaders to carefully steward the evolution of Downtown in a manner that is consistent with the long-term goals of the community for sustainability, resilience and well-being.  This report summarizes the core components of the Downtown Community Plan and provides information on the substantive outreach process, as well as input from the Planning Commission and other Boards and Commission that have weighed-in on the final draft.  For clarity, the report is organized into the following three chapters:  1.  THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN  2.  PLAN DEVELOPMENT AND FEEDBACK  3.  COUNCIL CONSIDERATIONS A.  Urban Design and Land Use Strategy For the past century, Downtown Santa Monica’s built environment has responded to various eras of change.  From its infancy as a crossroads of commerce and civic life, to its present day role as bustling local hangout and job/tourist center Downtown’s buildings stand as a record of human endeavor, and as a reflection of the zoning standards that each subsequent generation implemented to guide the urban form priorities of the day.  This incremental approach is responsible for the great diversity of building heights Downtown, which range from one-story brick and mortar structures to taller twenty-one-story glass and steel buildings.  The DCP acknowledges the interplay between the old and new as a necessary ingredient to Downtown’s authenticity, and presents an urban design strategy to safeguard the identifiable historic core within the Bayside Conservation District, and transfer unused development potential to the areas immediately served by the Expo Light Rail.  The 5-7 story height profile proposed by the DCP is framed by 4-story transition zones that gradually reduce height and scale at Downtown’s outer edges where it abuts the residential neighborhoods of Wilmont and Mid-City, and where views of the Pacific Ocean open up on Ocean Avenue. The development standards for the Plan’s six land use districts (Bayside Conservation, Neighborhood Village, Transit Adjacent, Lincoln Transition, Wilshire Transition, Ocean Transition) derive from the urban design strategy and provide equilibrium between the community’s desire to protect the historic scale of Downtown’s central walking area centered on the Third Street Promenade with the need to accommodate additional residential and commercial activities in areas that are regionally connected by transit. Land Use Downtown’s vibrancy is attributed to its unique mix of shops, restaurants, offices, institutions, health and well-being centers, entertainment venues, markets, apartments, and dozens of other offerings that are used daily by locals, employees and visitors. As the expanded boundaries of Downtown begin to transition into a mixed-use environment, the DCP provides a logical structure for regulating land uses in a way that is complimentary to the urban design strategy by directing the most intensive pedestrian-oriented uses to the historic core and transit area, and limiting the presence of larger more regionally-sized commercial uses adjacent to residential areas. This framework supports the DCP’s Land Use Regulations, which are finely-tuned to balance the Downtown’s various roles as urban neighborhood, regional job center and visitor destination. Urban Form and Building Design Santa Monica is renowned as a center of innovation and creativity, often leading the region - if not the nation – on issues of sustainability, community enrichment and urban policy.  These practices are woven throughout many adopted City documents, such as the Zoning Ordinance, that influence building design both in our commercial areas as well as in our residential neighborhoods.  In Downtown, the City has the opportunity to embody these principles in a new urban typology that celebrates architectural expression through flexible design standards.  The DCP departs from the rigid formulas of the past several decades that have produced “wedding cake” buildings, and instead employs a suite of percentage-based modulation requirements that allow for an architectural concept to drive building design. These standards, which ensure a consistent pedestrian-scaled streetwall, interior access to light and air, and communal open spaces for building residents, provide designers with a comfortable canvas for exemplary architecture while empowering planners and reviewing bodies with sufficient criteria to evaluate the merit of individual projects.  In response to comments received from the design community during the Planning Commission’s deliberations on the draft DCP, avenues for alternative compliance or modifications to standards along with strategic exemptions from standards for single lot projects were added to the Planning Commission’s recommended changes.  The Architectural Review Board (ARB) discussed the Downtown Community Plan at both their June 5, 2017 and June 19, 2017 meetings and generally endorsed the urban design strategy and urban form approach.  There was a robust exchange of ideas including discussion of design standards, modulation standards and design guidelines, the Bayside Conservation District and attention to potential historic resources and Landmark properties, open space provisions, as well as other aspects of the plan. The ARB Subcommittee also made many specific recommendations, identifying conflicts within the plan that needed clarification, and highlighting technical architectural items to be addressed with greater precision.  These items have been addressed in the staff-recommended Addenda (Attachment C).  The ARB is generally supportive of the Downtown Community plan presented.  The ARB had a particular interest and concern regarding the modulation standards and were focused on ensuring the adopted standards do not prevent or hinder innovation and/or excellence in design.  To that end, the ARB would like to support the following implementation actions:  ·  Add to Chapter 6, Implementation Actions a report on whether the development standards have resulted in desired outcomes.  The change is recommended on Page 249, Item 5A, Enforcement of Project Entitlements, “Review the design quality of downtown project to ensure diverse design typologies, innovation and quality design.” ·  The Board strongly endorses the use of resources such as the Downtown Santa Monica Inc. Ambassador Program and outreach to private property owners regarding possible management partnerships to ensure successful outdoor spaces are incorporated into existing and new projects. ·  The Board also endorses the action to develop a Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District (NCOD) in the Bayside Conservation District (BSCD).  Staff has added the ARB’s proposed implementation action to the staff-recommended Addenda.  Since the June ARB meetings, the Board’s DCP subcommittee submitted a recommendation to add a special alternative stepback option for all Districts.  The proposal would allow “forms, geometries, and skins such as layered facades and brise-soleils that do not fit the modulation standards but generally conform to the intent for three-dimensional design and to ensure light and air into buildings and down to the street to be considered on a case-by-case basis through discretionary review.” To this point, staff notes that the Plan already allows for architectural projections beyond the building frontage line for 2/3 of the façade and therefore, believes the forms and geometries contemplated by the ARB subcommittee would be accommodated within the Plan’s allowable projections. The Downtown Community Plan is a Housing Plan The Downtown Community Plan’s primary responsibility is to respond to the direction of the LUCE to encourage the growth of the residential population Downtown. This strategic land use emphasis is intended to accommodate the unmet demand for new housing in Santa Monica by directing the production of over 2,500 new units to an area that is rich with public transportation options and where higher densities can support a more sustainable development pattern. The primacy of housing development is highlighted in the DCP by policy and Plan standards that provide incentives to encourage the production of new housing units, both market-rate and affordable to people of lower incomes. The Housing Commission supports the DCP’s approach to housing production.  Housing Incentives ·  Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Bonus: housing projects have access to an additional 0.5 FAR bonus over commercial projects of a similar size. ·  Height Bonus on Lincoln and Wilshire Boulevards: housing projects on Lincoln and Wilshire Boulevard may achieve the maximum permitted height of the districts, whereas commercial projects are subject to a 10-foot reduction from the maximum permitted height. ·  PC RECOMMENDED: Process Incentives: entitlements for housing projects enjoy higher development review thresholds than their commercial counterparts. o  Housing projects up to 60,000 square feet (on lots no greater than 15,000 square feet) throughout the Downtown shall be processed through an Administrative Approval. o  Tier 3 housing projects up to 90,000 square feet in the Transit Adjacent District shall be processed through a Development Review Permit.  Affordable Housing Requirements In addition to the housing incentives that are provided in the DCP’s Standards and Regulations, affordable housing production will be stimulated by new requirements for Tier 2 and non-negotiated Tier 3 projects.  These requirements were determined based upon feasibility analyses prepared by HR&A (Attachment I). ·  Uniform Affordable Housing Requirement by Height: the DCP proposes a modified framework for affordable housing, compared to existing regulations, that requires a single percentage of on-site or off-site housing, depending on the proposed height of the project. ·  Increased On-site Affordable Housing Requirements: the DCP requires a greater percentage of deed-restricted affordable units than currently required. ·  Augmented Off-Site Affordable Housing Requirements: projects that wish to satisfy their Affordable Housing requirement off-site of the market-rate project will be subject to an even higher percentage of deed-restricted affordable units than the on-site equivalent.  Based on the Planning Commission’s review of the DCP Affordable Housing proposal, the distance that an off-site project can be located from its related market-rate project has been expanded to anywhere within the Downtown, or within one-quarter mile of the market rate project. ·  Mandated Affordable Income Level Mix: based upon the proportionate household income levels in the Housing Element Regional Housing Needs Assessment and requirements of Proposition R, the revised DCP includes a new requirement to provide a mix of income levels within the total affordable units required for the project so that each project provides units affordable to extremely low, very low, low and moderate incomes.  Exemptions for 100% Affordable Housing Projects ·  PC RECOMMENDED: Administrative Approval Threshold: 100% Affordable Housing projects up to 75 units may be approved administratively. ·  PC RECOMMENDED: Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Bonus: 100% Affordable housing projects in the Neighborhood Village have access to an additional 0.5 FAR bonus and 10 feet of additional height.  The DCP projects an estimated minimum of 2,500 new units produced over the next 15-20 years, which represents a doubling of the residential population that emerged over the past three decades. Most of the new housing projects will include a healthy mix of unit sizes and affordability levels based on the DCP’s policy direction and project requirements. It is important to note that 2,500 new units is a projection, not an absolute number, and could be increased upwards due to market forces that favor housing production over other land uses, such as commercial office or retail.  The DCP’s housing strategy and project requirements were reviewed by the Housing Commission at meetings on June 15, 2017 and June 20, 2017.  The Housing Commission endorses most aspects of the DCP’s housing approach including incentives for 100% affordable housing projects.  However, the Housing Commission recommends that additional project or process requirements be contemplated further. Many of these recommendations include changes to proposed measures in the Plan including ·  Eliminating CUP requirement for SRO projects ·  Rejecting the process incentives for housing projects recommended by the Planning Commission ·  Prohibiting any offsite affordable housing within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway ·  Ensuring that the Housing Element Quantified Objective and Proposition R production requirements have been met before middle-income units (130%-180% AMI as indicated in DCP) could be considered in development agreement negotiations  The inclusion of SRO projects as a permitted use is a change that will be reflected in the use table.  The streamlined process for typical housing projects recommended by the Planning Commission was based on the need to create a clear and predictable process for housing projects as compared to commercial projects.  To provide context to the location of offsite affordable housing, the Planning Commission discussed the limitation of residential uses within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway but did not impose any locational restrictions.  Further, much of the Transit Adjacent district is within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway.  Development agreement negotiations are conducted on a case-by-case basis so there would be no obligation to include any middle-income units.  The Housing Commission also made several recommendations that extend beyond the scope of what has been in the public discourse or in proposals presented by staff or the community, including: ·  A graduated affordable housing requirement that escalates up to 35% based on allowable height and FAR thresholds ·  Eliminating any office or retail uses above the ground floor for new buildings, with exceptions for areas that the Council deems appropriate. ·  Applying project requirements (i.e. affordability mix and average bedroom factor) to offsite 100% affordable housing projects with an exemption from the requirements only if necessary to obtain other forms of public financing ·  Biennial review of DCP Affordable Housing and AHPP requirements to determine if new incentives or requirements should be instituted ·  Encouraging ground floor residential units to have a preference for low-income disabled persons and artists, subject to City Attorney review regarding any fair housing implications ·  Reviewing the entire AHPP now for consistency with Prop R income targeting and rent limits and revise the affordability requirements outside of Downtown based upon new feasibility studies similar to that conducted for the DCP ·  Increasing deed-restriction terms on affordable units from 55 years to the life of the project ·  Identifying publically-owned land as a potential resource to achieve affordable housing goals  Staff appreciates the thoughtful detail that the Housing Commission put into their recommendations, some of which fall outside of the regulatory framework of the DCP in terms of deed restriction term limits and the framework of the AHPP.  Staff defers to Council on the subject of modified affordable housing requirements, but notes that a careful balance has been struck within the DCP between project requirements, fees, and process.  Any recommendation must also be supported by the HR&A feasibility analysis.  The elimination of office or retail space above the ground floor may appear attractive as a means to create housing projects but prohibiting office and retail above the ground floor must be carefully considered in balance with other uses that are vital to the City’s economy, social services network, or other important land uses that create a complete community.  The draft DCP proposes that offsite affordable housing projects must be owned in whole or part and operated by a non-profit housing provider.  It is likely that these providers will seek public financing that will dictate the affordability requirements of the project, which is why the DCP exempts 100% affordable housing projects from the project requirements for Tier 2 and Tier 3 projects.  However, there may be an instance where an offsite affordable housing project is completely privately financed.  In this case, the project would still be required to comply with the definition of a 100% affordable housing project per Section 9.52.020.0050 of the Zoning Ordinance (25% of units affordable to 60% income households with remainder affordable to 80% income households).  From a policy perspective, the net result is more affordable housing units and therefore, flexibility should be provided in how the offsite affordable housing is achieved.  With respect to preference for artists, a new policy has also been included to explore accommodating artists within ground floor residential units provided the classifications do not result in unintended discriminatory impacts.  The DCP includes a monitoring requirement that would produce a report concurrent with the LUCE monitoring.  The monitoring report would include data presented as part of the Proposition R annual reports.  Staff does not support a requirement that the DCP affordable housing requirements be reviewed every two years as there may not be sufficient data points to inform such a study. The Preservation of Existing Buildings is Strongly Supported Preserving the historic scale and character of Downtown’s beloved walking areas is a central objective of the DCP’s change strategy, which seeks to carefully retain many older structures that evoke nostalgia for Santa Monica’s colorful past.  The DCP improves upon previous historic preservation policies, and provides substantial support for adaptive reuse.  A six-step approach outlines a variety of economic and technical incentives.  Adaptive Reuse Incentives Exemptions from standard development requirements have been added to the DCP that create economic and technical incentives for owners of properties identified as City Designated Historic Resources or as potential historic resources. Several examples include exemptions from development standards, such as parking, open space, and certain use regulations that would create barriers to adaptive reuse. It should be noted that other technical incentives are available such as the California Historical Building Code, which recognizes older buildings often need alternative methods in meeting fire and life safety requirements.   Protections for Historic Resources A new protection included in the DCP is an action to submit the Downtown Historic Resource Inventory (HRI) to the State Office of Historic Preservation, which would mean that all HRI-listed properties are considered presumptive historic resources under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). CEQA requires that exterior alterations to historic resources comply with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.  If alterations are not in conformance or demolition is proposed, more detailed environmental review of the proposed project would be required, possibly including an Environmental Impact Report.  Several new process changes are also included in the DCP to facilitate the conservation of City Designated Historic Resources and potential historic resources Downtown. These include modified demolition screening procedures that require Landmarks Commission review of demolition permits for structures more than 40 years old and clearance of the required 75-day waiting period before any Planning application can be submitted.  This new procedure would serve as a means to identify potential historic resources prior to the submittal of an application, which would be complemented with an associated amendment to SMMC Article 8 (Building Regulations) to increase the lifespan for demolition applications.  Future actions to support this process change include updating the Landmarks Ordinance to provide alternative pathways to designation and the creation of a Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District within the Bayside Conservation District to identify design features that provide visual identity to 2 nd and 4 th Streets. Special standards for the Bayside Conservation District include eliminating the open space requirements and relaxed modulation requirements in order to clearly define the traditional streetwall of 2 nd and 4 th Streets. The Landmarks Commission reviewed the DCP’s approach to Historic Preservation at their June 12, 2017 meeting and supports the approach subject to the following recommended changes: ·  Specify possible funding sources for historic preservation ·  Assure that the existing provisions in the Municipal Code for expediting plan check occur in practice ·  Increase outreach and public education regarding historic preservation ·  Amend Policy HP2.4 to read, “Adaptive reuse of older building should be considered for new construction and rehabilitation projects, when the scale, materials or method of construction evokes Downtown’s history, and where the façade  building contributes to a continuous streetscape.” Staff supports the Landmarks Commission’s recommendations and has added relevant changes to the recommended Addenda. Going forward, staff will continue to look for opportunities to realize existing incentives for historic preservation, and to help expand outreach on this subject. New Public and Open Spaces are Prioritized throughout Downtown Because Downtown was largely developed as a commercial district it contains very few dedicated public spaces where groups can congregate.  While many of the existing parks or public spaces that are utilized by Downtown residents and visitors are located nearby in other districts (e.g. Tongva Park, Palisades Park, Reed Park); within Downtown, only the public right of way, and places like the Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica Place, and the Santa Monica Main Library serve as Downtown’s dedicated public open space offerings.  Recognizing this, the community overwhelmingly identified the maintenance, enhancement or creation of public space as the #1 priority for Downtown’s evolution.  The DCP looks at the public space network comprehensively, and acknowledges that a nuanced approach that involves both City and private interests must be considered.  To this end, the Plan emphasizes the role that private development must play to add new public spaces to Downtown.  The DCP identifies key sites where development has been proposed and where negotiations with property owners may yield significant public open space.  Similarly, the Public Space plan includes existing publically-accessible spaces (“POPs”) that should be redesigned to promote better access and programming, perhaps incentivized with a small modicum of new floor area.  Management and oversight of these spaces is paramount, and will require the involvement of City staff, DTSM and private property owners.  Based on outreach, smaller scale public spaces such as pocket parks, courtyards and plazas are preferred over larger open spaces such as a central park or recreation fields.   Additionally, the quality of Downtown’s streetscapes is to be improved to emphasize their role as public spaces and the opportunity they provide to further pedestrianize the area through wider sidewalks, a larger more verdant urban forest, and street furnishings that would make the walking experience more enjoyable.  Private Open Space in Housing Projects A new feature of the DCP’s zoning standards is the requirement for typical housing projects to provide on-site open space for residents’ use.  Depending on the size of the project area, a project is required to dedicate 20-25% of the total lot area to courtyards, rooftop gardens, balconies and other open space types, and of this percentage one-quarter must be designed for communal use. Single-lot projects are exempt from these standards.  The Recreation and Parks Commission (RPC) reviewed the DCP’s Public Space approach at their December 15, 2016 meeting and subsequently provided a letter expressing unanimous support for the various approaches and policies surrounding the creation or enhancement of public open spaces Downtown.  The RPC conditioned their support on several recommendations, including:  ·  That the DCP maximize every opportunity to create open space, including true green space, courtyards, plazas and paseos; ·  That the DCP identify parcels that would be suitable for acquisition for open space use; ·  That the DCP include policies reflecting the need to work with private property owners to activate empty plazas; ·  That ground floor open space be included in all residential projects; ·  That projects subject to DAs provide substantial open space benefits and that property owners should be held accountable for maintaining open space amenities to the highest levels.  Nearly all of the RPC’s recommendations have been addressed and incorporated into the final draft DCP. The one exception is the recommendation to require ground floor open space, which was not integrated into the final plan as it would conflict with the broader urban design strategy to maintain a consistent streetwall at the ground floor.  Encouraging Economic Vitality is Important to Downtown’s Future Downtown is a major employment center (approx. 25,000 jobs) and a revenue generator that supports the many programs, services and activities that residents citywide have come to enjoy. While constituting only 4.5% of the City, Downtown’s generates over a third of the total sales tax revenues for Santa Monica, and another third of all hotel room revenues citywide.  Additionally, fees collected from development to fund park maintenance, childcare programs, urban runoff projects, and transportation enhancements are largely drawn from projects located in Downtown. The combination of these elements has helped Downtown, and the city as a whole, weather challenging financial crises such as the Great Recession.  Given its prominence as Silicon Beach and a major tourist destination, one of Downtown’s inherent tensions is the degree to which it caters to locals, employees and visitors alike.  The challenge ahead is to ensure that it remains a place for everyone, and that opportunities for economic diversity are embraced.  The DCP weaves together policies and standards that create a “local business-friendly” environment that can provide space for a broad mix of job opportunities in new and expanding industries whether they be creative office and co-working spaces, retail, dining and entertainment, or hospitality. The Promenade is further supported through a variety of exemptions from design standards to allow for greater flexibility, and through a change to several regulations that currently restrict uses.  Going forward, an Action of the DCP is to work with Public Works and DTSM, Inc. on a Promenade improvement project to enhance its infrastructure, lighting and right-of-way features.  In the course of outreach, a clear preference emerged to support the creative economy, and to expand opportunities for local entrepreneurialism with small and medium-sized businesses.  To this end, the draft DCP includes a variety of changes from the zoning ordinance that are intended to reduce regulatory barriers for small businesses and typical changes of use. These include relaxed parking standards and less restrictive use regulations that ensure ground floor uses reflect the appropriate level of activity based on adjacency to residential uses.  The Downtown Santa Monica Inc. Board of Directors (DTSM) conducted a comprehensive review of the draft DCP and while there is agreement on many of the key approaches, there remains concern regarding the distribution of heights and densities across Downtown and the effect on housing production.  DTSM highlighted six key recommendations for the Council’s consideration: ·  Increase height and FAR in the BC and NV districts to 84 feet and FAR of 4.0 and to 60 feet and FAR of 2.75 for both sides of the Lincoln Transition district. ·  Provide streamlined process for granting flexibility from all aspects of retail space design and configuration standards to respond to the shifting retail environment. ·  Include a clear vision for a new state-of-the-art movie theater on the site of either Parking Structure #1 or #3. ·  Support for allowing ground floor office in midblock locations in the Neighborhood Village district as demand may not be sufficient to support retail in these locations resulting in vacancies detrimental to the neighborhood. ·  Include a clear statement on improvements to vehicle circulation with inclusion of a Vehicle Action Plan, similar in scope to Bike and Pedestrian Action Plans. ·  Consider flexibility in desired widths for sidewalk zones in order to accommodate space for outdoor dining.  As discussed later in the report highlighting issues for Council consideration, policy options are presented to address housing production and ground floor office in Neighborhood Village midblock locations.  The proposed heights and FARs in the Plan have been carefully crafted within the context of the urban design strategy to place the highest intensities closest to the Expo Station and to balance new development with the existing character of Downtown.  DTSM’s recommendations on a modification process for retail configuration are already included in the draft Plan.  Language regarding support for movie theaters is also included in the Addenda.  The sidewalk widths in the Plan are provided as conceptual illustrations and will be more comprehensively reviewed as part of the follow-up action to create a Downtown Streetscape Manual for how the public right-of-way is used and managed.  As discussed in the following section, the Plan proposes a comprehensive Mobility approach that addresses improvements for all modes.  A New Model for Mobility: Improving Today, Preparing for the Future A new model for mobility includes making more transportation options attractive, convenient, affordable, and safer so that people feel they can circulate without driving alone. It is an evolution of how people get to Downtown, and how they experience traveling within Downtown.  The creation of parking structures may have revived Downtown, Expo service has provided a new transit option, while the future is expected to include travel by driverless vehicles.  The ‘park once, pedestrians first’ mantra has been a guiding tenet for the past 30 years in Downtown. Recently Expo light rail service, pedestrian scramble intersections, a bike center, bicycle lanes and bike share have been introduced to Downtown. The next phase will likely see more changes related to car service (Lyft, Uber, taxi), increasing demand for curb space, and technology. Success of the area is tied to the success of the pedestrian environment – continuing to be a place that residents and visitors both want to walk from place to place.  Transportation in Downtown is as diverse as the people who travel there. Downtown is a place that welcomes the service workers who make it function, as much as resident visitors and tourists – who may take a bus, ride the train, drive with friends, or take a tour bus. People come in buses, carpools, on foot and by bike and walk throughout the district. Providing a quality transportation experience requires flexibility to make it more effective for all of these roadway users. This includes measuring our performance in making streets serve people first, and prioritizing modes that are more efficient.  A new focus in the DCP is the quickly-evolving technology influence on transportation, including electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and transit service provided by private organizations.  Since the inception of the development of this plan, car services, have gained widespread acceptance. The City’s response must be internal, by shaping choices so that the convenient option also meets community values, and external, by actively participating in the field of changing technology. The plan includes recommendations to work with businesses to provide micro-transit, to use technology to provide on-demand transit service, to focus on community priorities such as equitable access to autonomous vehicles, and to participate in regional transportation technology efforts. A new model for mobility requires changes to policies, new investments, different requirements for property owners, adapting business practices, and partnership with the Santa Monica community.  Art and Cultural Offerings Create New Opportunities Downtown The demand for new and more diverse art, cultural and entertainment activities is increasing Downtown. To establish Downtown’s identity as a major cultural center, the City must carefully consider new opportunities for cultural engagement to stretch Downtown’s vibrancy. Building from the traditionally retail-centered economic base, events, major artworks, unique creative expressions and live music will infuse the street and public spaces to strengthen Santa Monica’s as a cultural destination. Additional entertainment choices Downtown, particularly nighttime venues, will provide residents, employees and visitors with a wider array of destination experiences than in the past, such as live performance spaces for theater and live music. The Arts Commission supports the DCP’s approach to Art and Culture.  The DCP’s land use regulations now permit a larger range of art and cultural uses than historically permitted in the past.  The Plan includes an invitation to potential museum operators to work with the City to locate a museum Downtown, and identifies several locations where major works of public art could be located.  At its November 21, 2016 meeting the Arts Commission enthusiastically supported the inclusion of arts and culture into the DCP, and offered the several recommendations, which have largely been incorporated into the final Plan:  ·  Encourage policies and public/private partnerships that promote robust artistic activities throughout downtown, in businesses, open spaces and vacant storefronts. ·  Support Creative Placemaking efforts that enhance other city goals, such as mobility and activating open spaces. ·  Wherever possible, the DCP should ease restrictions and streamline procedures to facilitate pop-up art interventions in underutilized spaces. ·  Encourage the development of public and public/private open space, and provide incentives for artists and arts groups to work with City Cultural Affairs staff to develop and implement art and Creative Placemaking programs downtown. ·  Position Downtown Santa Monica as a cultural destination ·  Expand options for live music and the performing arts in downtown facilities and businesses. ·  Of the affordable housing that is produced Downtown, 10% of the units should be designed and set aside for artist housing or live/work units.  The DCP directly addresses all of the recommendations of the Arts Commission through its policy framework and subsequent implementation actions with the exception of the Arts Commission’s recent request that artist housing or live/work units be included as part of the DCP’s affordable housing requirements.  Additional refinements have been recorded in the recommended Addenda that reflect specific direction on certain actions.  Community Wellbeing The City’s Wellbeing Project looks beyond traditional performance measures or economic indicators and uses a new method to gain an understanding of how all of these factors interact and affect residents’ quality of life. The core of the project is the Wellbeing Index, which provides the City with a snapshot of its current wellbeing strengths and needs by analyzing data collected from residents, city departments and social media to gain a robust understanding of how the people of Santa Monica are doing across multiple measures known to influence wellbeing.  The Wellbeing Index demonstrates that Downtown residents benefit from many positive dimensions, such as access to healthy food, proximity to culturally enriching experiences and institutions, use and enjoyment of Downtown’s outdoor spaces, and frequent use of the many mobility options provided. However, the Index also points to areas of concern that highlight the growing pains of a residential neighborhood in its infancy.  The metrics for stress, stability and life/work balance all register slightly higher Downtown than any other neighborhood in the city.  One indicator of particular concern to the planning team reveals that Downtown residents do not feel connected to one another in the way that fosters community, trust among neighbors, and social interaction. Tying the results of the Index to Plan policies and standards strengthens the logic for prioritizing affordable housing, public open space, new neighborhood serving uses, youth and senior services, and many others.  The Social Services Commission submitted their recommendations to the Planning Commission on April 26, 2017.  Specifically, the Social Services Commission recommended the use of the Wellbeing Project data to guide development agreement negotiations and be used as a tool to advance a diverse and multigenerational Downtown community, support for affordable housing, and specificity for policies supporting wraparound community and social services to serve the Downtown community.  Recommendations that development projects include setasides for affordable/low-cost office space and community rooms could not be included due to lack of nexus between such requirements and new development; however, such amenities could be included in negotiated projects.  Many of the Social Services Commission’s recommendations were included in the Planning Commission’s final recommendation on the DCP. B.  IMPLEMENTING AND MONITORING THE PLAN Implementation of the DCP will be a shared responsibility. Chapter 6 outlines all actions in the Plan along with a relative estimate of cost, responsibility, timing, and potential funding sources (Table 6.1 of the draft Plan).  This can used as a budgeting tool and also as a means to support grant applications.  Table 6.1 demonstrates that implementation of the DCP will be a shared responsibility dependent on not only City leadership but also coordination with community partnerships and cooperation from private entities.  The DCP monitoring report will be prepared concurrent with the LUCE 5-year Measuring and Monitoring Report.  One key area that will be monitored is the development cap of 3.2M square feet of net new floor area in Downtown.  This development cap represents the amount of new development that could occur that would still allow achievement of the LUCE goal of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips.  Any project proposal that exceeds the cap would not be able to be approved until additional environmental analysis and amendments have been completed.  There are also other indicators to monitor the performance of the DCP listed on Page 247-249 of the draft Plan. A.  COMMUNITY OUTREACH Many years of outreach have marked the development of the DCP. Interdepartmental staff and the planning team have worked with community stakeholders and the City’s Boards and Commissions to tackle challenging issues in search of consensus, and have listened intently to the perspectives brought forward by the many voices involved in shaping the Plan.  Beginning in 2012, outreach on the DCP has taken on many forms, from workshops on Emerging Themes, Community Benefits, and Urban form, to stakeholder interviews and meetings with the Planning Commission and City Council.  In total, seven workshops were held to drill into Plan concepts and generate feedback from the community. At the onset of 2016, staff re-engaged the community on a variety of topics to move closer towards consensus and to refine the Plan.  2016 Outreach and Engagement Beginning shortly after the Planning Commission’s March 2 nd , 2016 meeting, staff launched an unprecedented outreach campaign to community groups and local organizations, employing the City’s Office of Communications as a partner in diversifying the input opportunities and in reaching new voices within the community. The outreach tools and platforms used to engage thousands of people were expansive and yielded greater detail about the community’s preference for things like open space, art and culture, mobility, jobs and housing and historic preservation. Importantly, the outreach also demonstrated that there are a great many perspectives on height, development and planning for large sites that have the ability to support much desired amenities.  A detailed breakdown of the 2016 outreach and supporting documentation is provided in the November 16, 2016 Planning Commission staff report. Below is a snapshot of last year’s outreach by the numbers:  ·  1,200 people provided feedback on Downtown priorities in workshops, focus groups and online ·  Over 40 community presentations were given to local groups and organizations in both English and Spanish ·  7 community conversation focus groups were held at the Main Public Library and at Senior Residences Downtown ·  3 public workshops were held on the subjects of Placemaking, Preservation and Change and Mobility ·  3 Downtown walking tours were co-hosted by the planning team and the Santa Monica Conservancy ·  4.6 million social media impressions were recorded on facebook, twitter and instagram ·  8,700 unique visits to the DCP website, www.downtownsmplan.org  Leading up to the release of the 2017 Final Draft Downtown Community Plan, staff held several events to provide a broad overview into the content of the Plan and to establish a rapport with interested community members who sought clarifications on key subjects or who had questions about the collective vision for Downtown’s future.  B.  ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a Program Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared that analyzed the potential environmental effects associated with the DCP.  The Draft Program EIR was circulated for a 90 day public review period beginning on February 3, 2016 (exceeding the minimum 45-day public review as required by Section 15067 of the CEQA Guidelines). In addition, a Recirculated Draft EIR was circulated for a 45-day public review period in February 2017 to reflect changes that were made to the draft DCP.  Comments on the Draft EIR and Recirculated Draft EIR included public concerns about development in Downtown, the Miramar established large site, height, traffic, aesthetics, and neighborhood character. The Final EIR provides written responses to all comments received on the Draft EIR and Recirculated Draft EIR. Some minor text changes and clarification were also included in the Final EIR.  The Final EIR analyzes the effect of potential land use changes that could occur in the Downtown through 2030 as a result of the implementation of the DCP, including review of the range of impacts between two different buildout scenarios. Scenario A (High Scenario) would entail higher FARs for sites in the Downtown with variation by district, and represents the City Council’s outside parameters for EIR analysis established during the August 13, 2013 meeting, which includes FARs up to 5.0 for the established large sites. Scenario B has a lower range of FARs, with up to 4.0 FAR for the established large sites. Scenario B represents a maximum cap of 3.22 million sf of net new floor area in the Downtown.  The Final EIR identifies significant and unavoidable impacts for air quality, construction effects, construction noise, cultural resources, and traffic. Specifically because the details of specific future projects occurring in the Downtown are unknown, the Final EIR concludes that construction-related air emissions and noise (vibration) would be significant and unavoidable. Furthermore, although the DCP would establish greater preservation policies and standards, the Final EIR concludes that historic impacts would be significant and unavoidable since individual projects could involve the demolition or alteration of a historic resource. Additionally, due to the City’s stringent thresholds for traffic and the existing levels of traffic in Downtown, the Final EIR identifies significant and unavoidable impacts with respect to traffic (automobile delay). Aesthetic impacts of the DCP, including those due to building height, are considered less than significant pursuant to Section 21099 of the CEQA Statute, which states that aesthetic impacts of residential, mixed use, and employment center projects in transit priority areas are considered less than significant.  Most importantly, the Final EIR concludes that Scenario B of the DCP (with 3.2 million sf cap) would achieve the goals of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips by 2030, and would reduce per capita vehicles miles traveled (VMT) and greenhouse gas emissions, which is consistent with the intent of SB743 and upcoming changes to CEQA. Additionally, as noted in the Final EIR, the DCP implements the sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction goals and policies established in the City’s LUCE, Sustainable City Plan, Climate Action Plan, and SCAG’s Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy. The DCP is based on a vision of supporting and enhancing the Downtown as a multi-modal district that is fully integrated with the Downtown Station of the Expo LRT. The DCP also emphasizes new land uses in areas proximate to the Downtown Station to minimize vehicle trip generation, vehicle miles traveled, and associated GHG emissions. Additionally, the Plan would enhance multi-modal relationships, calling for new connections and circulation improvements for all modes as well as aggressive TDM measures such as employer trip reduction plans and subsidized transit passes or transportation allowances for residents and employees. Collectively, the standards, policies, and programs in the DCP would support sustainability and GHG reduction goals established by the State, region, and City.  As required under CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(a), the Final EIR includes a discussion and evaluation of "a reasonable range of alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly obtain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives." The EIR provides a robust analysis of the DCP as well the following alternatives. The alternatives analysis provides City decision-makers with a reasonable range of alternatives to consider to reduce or avoid impacts. ·  Alternative 1 – No Project Alternative; ·  Alternative 2 – Reduced Project (Elimination of Tier 3) Alternative; ·  Alternative 3 – 4 th /5 th Streets On-Way Streets Circulation Plan; ·  Alternative 4 – Expanded One-way Streets Circulation Plan; and ·  Alternative 5 – Hotel/Tourism-focused Land Use Mix Alternative.  CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6 requires that an EIR identify the Environmentally Superior Alternative to the proposed project from among the alternatives analyzed. If the No Project Alternative is found to be environmentally superior alternative, the EIR also identifies an Environmentally Superior Alternative from among the other alternatives. For a broad policy document such as the DCP, the potential exists that there may not be a clear Environmentally Superior Alternative. An alternative may have some reduced impact levels and other impacts that are greater than the project, while another alternative reduces different impacts. Although CEQA does not provide specific guidance in this matter, where a project has lower impacts in a majority of resource areas and/or substantially lower impacts in especially critical resource areas, this can support a finding that that alternative is environmentally superior.  Alternative 2 (Elimination of Tier 3 Projects) would reduce transportation-related impacts on intersections; however, elimination of Tier 3 developments would substantially reduce community benefits and substantial affordable housing and multi-modal transportation investment opportunities within the Downtown, potentially resulting in increased vehicles miles traveled. Therefore, in comparing an incremental reduction in the severity of significant impacts with the achievement of Project goals and objectives, the EIR determined that the implementation of Scenario B of the DCP would be the environmentally superior alternative. Implementation of Scenario B would incrementally reduce potential environmental impacts relative to Scenario A, but implementation of Scenario B would also still achieve all of the goals and objectives of the DCP. The Final EIR was presented to Planning Commission for review in April 2017, who recommended certification of the Final EIR.  Adoption of the DCP would require Council certification of the Final EIR, and adoption of a Statement of Overriding Considerations and the mitigation measures identified in the Final EIR.  Mitigation measures are identified in the Final EIR in the areas of Air Quality, Biological Resources, Construction Effects (Air Quality), Cultural Resources, Hazards/Hazardous Materials, Public Services, Utilities, and Transportation and Circulation.  To ensure that these measures are properly enacted, a mitigation monitoring program is necessary and will be enforced during the construction and operation of the project.  C.  PLANNING COMMISSION COMMENTS ON THE PLAN During the months of April and May 2017 the Planning Commission held six public hearings to discuss the DCP (April 25, May 10, May 11, May 17, May 18 and May 31) and its Program Environmental Impact Report. These meetings, which spanned over 40 hours of discussion, also provided the opportunity for the community to comment on the Plan’s content, and for staff to clarify concepts.  The Commission recommended adoption of the DCP with specific amendments and modifications that are listed in Exhibit B to the adopting resolution (Attachment B). The modifications largely pertain to key development standards and Plan policy that encourage the production of housing, as well as the range and location of land uses that are desired for the area.  Housing Production Among the productive clarifications to design standards, mobility actions, open space creation and well-being targets, the Planning Commission’s most impactful recommendations were to increase several housing-related process thresholds to further stimulate housing production Downtown.  Hence, the Commission has recommended that typical mixed-use housing projects up to 60,000 square feet, on lots no greater than 15,000 square feet, be processed ministerially through an Administrative Approval, which would greatly reduce the time necessary to process a development application.  In the Transit Adjacent District, the only area in Downtown that has a Tier 3 option, the Commission recommends a Development Review Permit process for housing projects up to 90,000 square feet.  This process threshold represents the amount of maximum allowable floor area that could result from a project located on a three-lot site of 22,500 square feet.  The Planning Commission’s recommendation was based on overall consensus that this area can support greater densities on account of proximity to the Expo Light Rail.  Comparison of DCP to Planning Commission recommendations for Housing Project Review Process    Less than 30,000 SF Project on lots up to 15,000 SF (typically results in projects less than 60,000 SF) All Tier 2 Tier 3 30,000 - 60,000 SF Tier 2 on lots over 15,000 SF Tier 3 on lots over 15,000 SF and up to 90,000 SF Tier 3 over 60,000 SF Tier 3 over 90,000 SF  Established Large Site Standards and Process Lastly, the Commission spent considerable time discussing the DCP’s options for the Established Large Sites, three sites within Downtown that - given their parcel size - could potentially provide significant community benefits for circulation, open space and cultural facilities that would otherwise not be anticipated from smaller projects. The inclusion of these sites into the Plan sparked the most extensive and spirited debate among Planning Commissioners.  There was consideration of various modifications to the staff recommendation.  In the end, without majority support for any particular approach to these sites, the Commission narrowly recommended (4-3 straw vote) the removal of the Established Large Site Overlay, which provides unique height and FAR standards for these sites.  Commissioners who favored including the Established Large Site Overlay sought to establish the DCP as a comprehensive planning tool that creates clear parameters and expectations for projects on the three sites.  The Commissioners also supported a transparent and rigorous public review process that requires a development agreement, additional environmental review, and includes special application requirements for the applicant to demonstrate how the project meets the DCP’s objectives.  The Commission discussed potentially reducing the maximum height to approximately 100 feet with a setback from Ocean Avenue.  These Commissioners expressed concern about reviewing Specific Plan amendments for individual projects soon after adoption of the DCP.  Commissioners who did not favor including the Established Large Site Overlay supported having the height and FAR standards in Chapter 4, Table 4.2 apply to all Downtown projects.  These Commissioners expressed concern that District height limits should not be exceeded and authorizing greater height and FAR in the Plan would signal that increased height is acceptable.  There was a desire to ensure that the appropriate form in Downtown is established first through the DCP’s base standards and not influenced by community benefits and project amenities.  These Commissioners agreed that applicants for each project should submit Specific Plan Amendments for review on a project-by-project basis.  Similarly, the Commission rejected a selection of process options that would have required voter approval or a supermajority of Council to effect changes to the adopted DCP.  The Commission was nearly unanimous (6-1 straw vote) in the belief that Council authority is sufficient to render decisions related to Plan amendments, and that the referendum process established in State law provides appropriate opportunities for voters to challenge Council’s legislative actions.  Access and Mobility The Planning Commission has actively provided feedback on the Access and Mobility chapter specific actions and overall approach. Following discussion with the Commission, the Plan now calls for preparing for emerging technologies that serves the community’s vision, strengthens the plans consistency with Vision Zero, and updates parking policies that the Commission has since suggested amending. The Commission strongly communicated a desire to not only be forward-thinking but aggressive with implementation, as reflected in the errata sheet recommended by the Commission.  The DCP addresses steps to ensure how technology can best be used to make Downtown’s existing transportation network work better for people. The Plan includes an approach to making travel information easier to access through real-time information for transit service, bike share availability, travel times, and parking availability. A methodological use of information on parking and travel patterns can also be used to plan for and manage peak travel periods, which allow for having the right amount of people working at the right times to assist travelers and deployment of the most effective changes needed during peak travel periods.  Technology is increasing the viability of shared rides, microtransit or privately owned transit, autonomous vehicles, and widespread acceptance of electric vehicles. The DCP provides direction on how technology can be integrated with transportation in Downtown and how Santa Monica can participate in guiding the development of these technologies in the region.  Parking Climate change, traffic congestion, and changing usage patterns necessitate shifting parking policies. The Commission has affirmed the right-sizing and right-placing by having a discreet amount of new parking primarily on the periphery of Downtown. There has also been support for studying and then supporting private parking availability for the public.  Parking related changes suggested to Council by the Planning Commission include: ·  Creating a new parking district in the Zoning Ordinance specifically for the Downtown that supports preservation of buildings through greater flexibility when a use changes. The DCP parking requirements recommend a universal parking rate of 1 space per 500 square feet for all retail and restaurant uses under 5,000 square feet, parking rates are similarly adjusted for residential units. (Zoning Ordinance Amendments) ·  Enabling the phased development of up to 800 public parking spaces in peripheral locations to address future demand without incentivizing additional vehicle trips downtown (Action AM3.6C) ·  Pursuing the elimination of 600 public parking spaces within the Bayside Conservation District within 10 years of adoption of the plan. (New AM3.6 Action) ·  Re-evaluating private parking requirements after 1,500 new parking spaces have been entitled (Action AM3.5G) ·  Establishing demand-sensitive variable parking pricing, time-limits and marketing. (AM3.6A) ·  Encouraging use of convenient parking for short-term use through pricing and time restrictions, including installation of meters on 6 th and 7 th Streets. (new AM3.6B) ·  Completing the expansion of the Parking In-Lieu Fee program to include all properties in the DCP boundaries by 2019. (Action AM4.5F) ·  Requiring that new public parking must be built entirely outside of the Bayside Conservation District, including on projects that may overlap with that district, such as the city-owned 4 th /5 th /Arizona site (new AM3.6 action)  The Planning Commission also made a number of recommendations in regards to bicycling, walking and resident access including aggressive implementation timelines. Specific recommendations include: ·  Creation of protected bike facilities on Ocean Avenue, 2ne Street, and Broadway (Action AM4.3B) ·  Minimizing the closure of bike and pedestrian facilities due to construction and providing clear and direct alternates when closure is necessary. (Actions AM1.2E and AM1.2F) ·  Pursuing the creation of a Santa Monica resident transportation pass or credit usable for select mobility services and parking access Downtown, especially during off-peak periods. (Action 4.1K)  A.  SPOTLIGHT ISSUES FOR COUNCIL CONSIDERATION This section of the report identifies several “spotlight” issues for Council consideration that were raised in the course of the Planning Commission’s deliberations on the DCP. The DCP provides for ample housing production over the life of the Plan through a variety of process and technical incentives that are designed to steer development towards the creation of new residential units.  These incentives include a .5 FAR bonus for housing projects over their commercial counterparts, as well as some additional height in the transition zones. Coupled with project requirements for new Affordable Housing, the DCP housing production incentives create the condition to achieve the forecasted minimum of 2,500 new units within the next 15 years.  The possibility for additional square footage for housing exists within the volume of development contemplated in the Plan’s EIR, potentially adding up to roughly 3,100 new units if less commercial, medical or institutional uses are proposed than originally forecasted.  Recent criticism of the DCP’s housing approach has raised the specter of the nationwide housing crisis with many proponents demanding higher heights and densities than currently proposed or even studied in the EIR.  Public testimony and correspondence point to a sentiment that Santa Monica must do more to provide housing to those in need, even though the City is well on track to achieve or surpass its Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) number given by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), and that Downtown has the highest allowable FARs in the entire City.  During the Planning Commission hearings, the Commission recommended several process and technical incentive changes that fast-track housing projects Downtown, such as an Administrative Approval process for typical two-lot projects that typically result in projects of approximately 5-6 stories and 60 units.  The Commission also recommended a more permissive administrative threshold for 100% Affordable Housing projects and height and FAR increases for 100% Affordable Housing in the Neighborhood Village District.  For Council Consideration : Should the Council wish to go beyond the DCP’s recommended “housing-first” strategy, the following options are presented for consideration: Option 1 : Increase process thresholds by which more housing projects would qualify for streamlined entitlements. Option 2 : Further reduction in height and FAR for commercial projects (e.g. 10’ and 0.5 FAR). Option 3 : Require all projects on sites of greater than 15,000 square feet to have at least 50% of the floor area be residential uses, except for hotels, movie theaters, auto dealers, public infrastructure, and the Third Street Promenade. Option 4 : Increasing the height and FAR standards, subject to additional environmental evaluation  Table of Supporting and Opposing Arguments for Each Policy Alternative   1 ·  Provides significant time incentives for developers to seek housing ·  Creates certainty for community and developer ·  Perception of reduction in opportunities for public participation 2 ·  Would clearly establish preference for housing projects by further reducing height and FAR for commercial projects ·  Overall reduction in height and FAR for commercial projects was done for neighborhood transitions but implementing this strategy in Downtown core could have unintended consequence of affecting Downtown economic vitality 3 ·  Guarantees that any larger project would be required to have 50% residential use, prohibiting strictly office and retail projects (exempting hotels, movie theaters, auto dealers, public infrastructure, and buildings on the Third Street Promenade. ·  Blanket standard that prescribes land use mix and reduces flexibility in land use decisions ·  Proscriptive approach instead of providing incentives 4 ·  Could result in potentially more than 2,500 new housing units if FAR standards are increased ·  Would not result in substantially more housing units ·  Inconsistent with urban design strategy proposed in DCP and widely discussed and endorsed by the community  Staff Recommendation Staff recommends further process incentives be considered as described in Option 1, as they would provide clear project requirements with predictable timelines established in DCP.  The Planning Commission recommended that an Administrative Approval process would be appropriate for projects on sites no greater than 15,000 square feet.  The Commission also recommended that a Development Review Permit would be appropriate for Tier 3 projects no greater than 90,000 square feet in the Transit Adjacent District.  This was intended to allow typical housing projects that are similar in size and scale to housing projects that already exist in the Downtown leaving larger projects subject to Planning Commission review.  As a further process incentive, Council could establish a higher threshold for Administrative Approvals (AA) that would provide predictability to applicants with respect to number of housing units authorized, amount of affordable housing units required, affordability level of units, open space requirements, and certainty in applicable development standards.  The Administrative Approval (AA) process provides certainty that the project will be approved if it meets all of the DCP’s project requirements.  This class of housing projects would be required to obtain a recommendation from the ARB before the AA could be approved and would still need to obtain final approval on the project design from the ARB.  This process is similar to the procedural incentives that were formerly in place for Downtown in the 1990s that resulted in the production of approximately 2,500 housing units over the course of three decades. The significant difference is the DCP has a variety of development standards in place that are intended to ensure that projects not only complement Downtown’s existing character but also contribute to the implementation of Downtown as a vibrant, walkable place that welcomes a diverse population of all income levels. The Planning Commission’s narrow recommendation to remove the Established Large Site Overlay from the DCP points to the divergence of opinions surrounding tall buildings in Downtown Santa Monica.  Outreach to the community on this subject was balanced at opposite ends, with roughly 50% in favor and another 50% opposed.  Those in favor of the Overlay, which would allow three projects to propose building heights up to 130’ within an established planning framework, argued that the potential benefits for open space, historic preservation, and mobility outweighed potential negative impacts associated with shade/shadow and scale.  Those opposed to the Overlay expressed concern that Santa Monica’s identity as a low-scale coastal community would be compromised by tall buildings, and further – that the DCP’s standards should reflect a level playing field for all development, and not single out a few exceptions.  For Council Consideration : Should the DCP include the Established Large Site Overlay, which would authorize consideration of height up to 130 feet and additional FAR on three sites in Downtown?  Staff Recommendation on Height for Established Large Sites The concept of the Established Large Site Overlay presented in the draft DCP seeks to establish clear expectations in terms of maximum height, appropriate FAR, and open space requirements for three sites in Downtown.  The proposal also establishes a rigorous review process that requires a development agreement application and includes additional environmental review and a comprehensive application that demonstrates how the project meets DCP priorities.  No Specific Plan Amendment would be required.  As legislative actions, development agreements would be subject to the voter approval process already established in State law.  Staff believes that there are site-specific reasons why allowing for additional height would lead to superior outcomes for future development on these sites.  Staff also believes that imposing a clear maximum height for future projects on those sites provides clarity and coherence to protect the integrity of the overall plan that would be absent if property owners/developers could seek consideration for essentially unlimited heights for projects on those sites – or could seek additional heights on sites where positive trade-offs simply do not apply.  Allowing the projects to move forward with the 130’ height would allow flexibility for more ground level public space, preservation of historic buildings and features (currently on two of the three sites) and the opportunity for more distinctive and functional architectural massing, modulation and design.  Options for Established Large Site Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Each of the Established Large Sites have individual FAR parameters, which dictate the mass and scale of the projects. While the proposed height of these projects has been the focus of discussions, the projects’ FARs also have the potential to directly influence the project and community benefits that could be achieved on these three sites. Should Council seek options for exploring revised FARs for these sites, staff proposes three options for consideration: Option 1: Maintain the DCP’s existing individual FAR parameters for the Established Large Sites, which were originally presented in the 2014 version of the DCP, and in all subsequent drafts leading up to the final DCP. Were this option to be adopted, it would reflect the original development parameters that have been consistently discussed throughout the multi-year public process of creating the DCP and the proposals that have been submitted to the City by the applicants. Option 2: Modify the DCP’s FAR parameters such that all three Established Large Sites would be subject to a universal 3.0 FAR, which represents an average of the development potential across all three sites provided by the DCP’s base development standards for each Zoning District. Were this option to be adopted, it would reduce development potential for two of the three sites and ensure that the development of all three Established Large Sites would not exceed the theoretical development potential of the total land area of all three sites were these parcels developed in a series of typical two- or three-lot projects as opposed to the larger block-level projects that have been proposed. Option 3: Modify the DCP’s FAR parameters such that the FAR for each of the three sites would be limited to the maximum FAR established for each Zoning District averaged across the whole site.  Were this option to be adopted, it would reduce development potential for two of the three sites, which in turn may limit certain aspects of the proposed projects.  Comparison between three FAR options for the Established Large Sites        1133 Ocean Avenue 191,664 sf FAR=3.0  FAR=3.0     FAR: 2.75 (OT) [AVG = 2.75 FAR]  191,664 x 2.75 = 527,076 sf  101 Santa Monica Blvd 82,500 sf FAR=4.0   FAR=3.0       FAR: 3.5 (BC) Split Zone 2.75(OT) [AVG = 3.0 FAR]  31,010 x 3.5 = 108,535 sf 51,490 x 2.75 = 141,598 sf  4 th /5 th and Arizona 112,000 sf FAR=3.5   FAR=3.0       FAR: 3.5 (BC) Split Zone 3.25 (NV) [AVG = 3.4 FAR]  56,000 x 3.5 = 196,000 sf 56,000 x 3.25 = 182,000 sf  If the Established Large Site Overlay is not included in the DCP, the three sites would be required to comply with the height and FAR standards established in the development standards table.  Where there are split zones, the separate development standards for the portion of the property within each applicable zoning district would apply.  As a result, applicants would need to submit Specific Plan Amendments for each individual project. Because the DCP takes a “housing-first” approach, commercial office uses in Downtown’s active and transitional areas are limited predominantly to upper floors or at the rear of a project.  The one area of the Downtown where commercial offices are permitted at the ground floor is in the Neighborhood Village District, where many existing ground floor offices, such as the Chamber of Commerce, are currently located.  At its final hearing on the DCP, the Planning Commission voted to recommend that commercial office in the Neighborhood Village be limited to upper floors or at the rear of a project. Staff is concerned that this recommendation will render many existing offices non-conforming.  Additionally, staff is concerned that there is not enough retail demand to justify the elimination of ground floor office (which includes “walk-in clientele”), and could have the unwelcome effect of producing vacant storefronts.  For Council Consideration : Should the Planning Commission’s recommendation to eliminate all ground floor office from the Plan be adopted? If not, the following option is recommended by staff:  Staff Recommendation Based on an existing land use survey of the Neighborhood Village District, offices currently make up approximately 45% of the ground floor street frontage.  The Planning Commission’s recommendation would make all of these ground floor uses non-conforming and replace them with potentially residential or retail uses as change occurs.  A 2015 Downtown market outlook report that was used as a point of comparison for the Buildout Analysis demonstrated limits to the amount of retail space that could be feasibly supported in the DCP boundaries.  The land use strategy in the DCP establishes the Neighborhood Village District as an area of mixed activity where non-active uses such as residential and office uses could be allowed on the ground floor in mid-block locations only.  More active retail and restaurant spaces are strategically targeted for corner locations.  The existing retail spaces in these mid-block locations have historically been difficult to lease and the ground floor non-active uses would likely have better compatibility with the residential uses that are anticipated in the district.  B.  AMENDMENTS TO RELATED DOCUMENTS Various associated amendments to the Land Use and Circulation Element, Civic Center Specific Plan, and Zoning Ordinance are necessary to implement the goals and policies of the draft DCP.  Upon receiving direction from Council’s deliberations on the Plan, staff anticipates bringing these associated resolutions and ordinances to Council for formal action on July 25, 2017.  LUCE Amendment The LUCE is proposed to be amended to reflect the elimination of Tier 3 on Lincoln Boulevard and within the Wilshire Transition district.  CCSP Amendment The CCSP is proposed to be amended to remove the Colorado Avenue Special Use District.  This change is necessary to eliminate overlap and the potential for conflicting regulations between the DCP and CCSP boundaries.  Zoning Ordinance Amendments The DCP will be incorporated by reference into the Zoning Ordinance.  Where there is a conflict between the Zoning Ordinance and DCP, the DCP shall prevail.  Where the DCP is silent, the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance shall apply.  There are also a number of zoning ordinance amendments that are associated with the DCP that are being proposed to complement the standards of the draft DCP.  These include the following:  ·  Fence, Wall, Hedge height limits – establish fence, wall and hedge standards within the Downtown Community Plan area ·  Demolition Requirements – requires that demolition application screening and 75-day period are cleared before an application may be accepted for filing ·  Parking o  Establish parking maximums o  New parking requirements o  Incorporate parking in-lieu fee ·  Outdoor dining standards – clarify the name of the outdoor dining standards and clarify that the City Manager may promulgate guidelines necessary to implement outdoor dining requirements  Associated with the above Zoning Ordinance amendments are anticipated amendments to Division 6 (Land Use and Zoning Related Provisions) and Article 8 (Building Regulations).  These include a 100% transportation allowance for nonresidential projects and nonresidential components of mixed-use projects based upon Downtown’s higher average vehicle ridership (AVR) target of 2.2 and voter approval procedures for development agreements, if applicable.  An amendment to SMMC Section 8.08.060 is proposed to extend the expiration time limits for demolition applications to accommodate the new demolition review procedures.  These proposed amendments are attached to this staff report to inform Council’s consideration of the DCP. 	\N	16
77	Accept Streetlight Assessment Petitions and Set a Public Hearing	Public Works, Civil Engineering	The creation of assessment districts for installation of new street lights in residential areas is initiated by petition of the residents and/or property owners in accordance with Santa Monica Municipal Code section 7.04.860 . The process of creating the three street light assessment districts and imposing assessments must comply with Prop 218 and is authorized by State law under the Municipal Improvement Act of 1911. Successful petitions have been received from residents on 10th Street between Carlyle Avenue and Marguerita Avenue (District “A”), 25 th Street between Idaho Avenue and Washington Avenue (District “B”), and 27 th Street between Pico Blvd. and Pearl Street (District “C”) .  Staff has undertaken the process of holding community meetings with interested parties for each of the proposed assessment districts and has estimated the project cost of $158,500 for District “A”, $149,000 for District “B”, and $248,000 for District “C”.  The special benefit assessment has been calculated by the Assessment Engineer as 95% of the estimated project costs for each assessment district.  However, the City’s historic practice to encourage these districts has been to contribute fifty (50%) of the project costs. Therefore, the proposed assessments will be significantly less than the determined special benefit calculated by the assessment engineer. The City could offer assistance to Low and Moderate Income ( LMI ) owner-occupied properties, contingent on income verification . 	\N	The creation of assessment districts for installation of new street lights in residential areas is initiated by petition of the residents and/or property owners in accordance Santa Monica Municipal Code section 7.04.860.

The City’s Rent Control Board has verified the signed petitions. Signed petitions are available for public review in the Department of Public Works. Staff recommends City Council accept the petitions for the formation of these street light assessment districts. Upon acceptance and adoption of the resolutions of intent for each assessment district pursuant to the Improvement Act of 1911 , notices of the City’s intent to form the assessment district s and hold the public hearing s for each district  would be mailed to affected property owners forty-five (45) days in advance of the public hearing , in accordance with the notice and protest procedures under Proposition 218 . In addition to the notice s , affected property owners would also receive a ballot with the option to vote for or against the assessment. A list of properties within the proposed assessment districts and the assessment district maps would be available for review at the time of the public hearing s . Staff recommends that the City Council set the public hearing s on July 25 , 2017 for the formation of these streetlight assessment districts.  Affected property owners may return their ballots by mail or deliver them to the City Clerk prior to the close of the public hearing. At the hearing, the City Council would hear all public comment to the proposed assessment. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the assessment ballots submitted, and not withdrawn, in support of or in opposition to the proposed assessment would be tabulated. Tabulation of the assessment ballots would be weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected property. No assessment would be imposed if there is a majority of votes opposing the assessment.  Further, staff from the Rent Control Agency has verified that landlords of rent-controlled properties in Districts “A”, “B”, and “C” could also pass the assessment through to their tenants.  Public Outreach Public meetings were held on February 7 and 9, 2017 at the Ken Edwards Center to discuss assessment procedures , such as  the type of poles , location,  schedule, and  general cost s of the streetlights. Consistent with Council policy, adopted January 23, 2001, to only install ornamental post-top style street lights on residential streets, residents were provided information on the three approved standard ornamental post-top type poles for residential streets (Attachments 1, 2 and 3).  Selection of the final pole style for each district will be chosen by a majority vote of the property owners within each district during the design phase.  	\N	17
78	Appeal (17ENT-0016) of the Planning Commission's Approval of a Conditional Use Permit (16ENT-0128) to Allow a Type 47 alcohol license in conjunction with a new full-service, 3,306 square foot 102 seat restaurant (Avery) comprised of 92 indoor dining seats (12 bar seats) and 10 outdoor seats located within a ground floor space of the Shore Hotel located at 1530 2nd Street.	Development Review 1	On August 16, 2016 the applicant, Full of Flavor LLC, filed a Conditional Use Permit application to establish a full service restaurant with alcohol service on the property at 1530 2 nd Street . On February 1, 2017, the Planning Commission approved a Conditional Use Permit (16ENT-0128) to allow a Type-47 alcohol license in conjunction with the full service restaurant , subject to conditions of approval in the Statement of Official Action . The appellant, UNITE HERE Local 11, filed a timely appeal  on February 14, 2017 (17ENT-0016) of the Planning Commission’s approval of Conditional Use Permit 16ENT-0128.  The appellant requests that City Council overturn the Planning Commission’s approval of the Conditional Use Permit (CUP), stating that the findings cannot be made or justified, the conditions of approval are not adequate and that the use is inconsistent with the CUP conditions of approval placed upon the Shore Hotel (property owner) as a limited amenity hotel. Lastly, the appellant noted that since the Shore Hotel is currently in litigation with the Coastal Commission regarding their Coastal Development Permit, it is not appropriate to approve a restaurant use with alcohol service because it benefits the property owner.  Pursuant to the City’s Downtown Interim Ordinance (IZO) No. 2522 (CCS), which established interim procedures and regulations for Downtown pending completion of the Downtown Community Plan, this project is being reviewed for compliance with the 1988 zoning ordinance.  The site is located in the C3 zoning district.  This report summarizes the Planning Commission’s action, the points of each appeal provided by the appellant, the applicant rebuttal and staff’s analysis. This report concludes with a recommendation from staff to uphold the Planning Commission’s approval of the Conditional Use Permit based upon the findings and subject to the conditions adopted by the Planning Commission on February 1, 2017. 	The following is a summary of prior permits that have been issued for the subject property: DR 05-007, CUP 05-009, GPA 06-001 and VAR 06-018 (approved March 19, 2008) Development  Review Permit, Conditional Use Permit, General Plan Amendment and Variance was approved by the Planning Commission for the new Shore Hotel.  APP08-006; APP08-007 (approved September 23, 2008)   The Planning Commission’s approval of the Development Review Permit, Conditional Use Permit, and Variance for the Shore Hotel was appealed.  On September 23, 2008, the City Council denied the appeal and approved the DR, CUP, and Variance for the Shore Hotel with modified conditions. Conditions of approval for the project limited proposed amenities to a 370 square foot exercise room, a 750 square foot meeting room/breakfast room, swimming pool and spa pools and prohibited a restaurant, bar, conferencing facilities, spa, florist, lounge or similar amenities typically found in more upscale or luxury hotels. T he separate commercial spaces along Ocean Avenue and 2 nd Street are exempt and not subject to these restrictions.   11CUP003; 11CUP004; 11CUP005 (approved August 10, 2011)  The owner of the Shore Hotel requested and received three separate Conditional Use Permits for alcohol service within the project site. 11CUP003 was approved in anticipation of a proposed restaurant at 1530 2 nd Street Space B (the subject space); 11CUP004 was approved for alcohol sales within the hotel’s guest rooms (mini-bars)  and on-site hotel bar; and 11CUP005 was approved for the restaurant on Ocean Avenue currently operated by Blue Plate Taco (Space A) with specific operational conditions, which were  complementary to the hotel’s conditions to be a limited-amenity hotel.  Specific operational conditions associated with the Space A and B alcohol conditional use permits were included to more clearly define the separation of the Hotel from the two independently owned on-site restaurants .  These conditions o f approval included the following : ·  No restaurant delivery to the hotel guestrooms shall occur unless delivery is offered as part of the restaurant’s typical operations. ·  No food orders to the restaurant shall be processed through the hotel. ·  No restaurant charges shall be included on the hotel bill. ·  The operation of the restaurant must be separate and distinct from the operation of the hotel.  Further, t he Planning Commission approval of 11CUP003 (the subject space) authorized seating arrangements for 74 sit-down patrons plus two (2) waiting area seats and hours of alcohol service : ·  Sunday through Wednesday - 10:00 AM to 1:00 AM (interior dining area) and 10:00 AM to 12:00 Midnight (outdoor dining area) ; ·  Thursday through Saturday - 10:00 AM to 2:00 AM (interior dining area) and 10:00 AM to 1:00 AM (outdoor dining area) .  However, Conditional Use Permit 11CUP003 expired because operations did not commence.  14PSP008 (approved February 2, 2015)  A Performance Standards Permit granting a small, satellite automobile rental agency was approved within the Shore Hotel.  The use continues to operate at two small counters totaling 280 square feet within the hotel.  Planning Commission Action The Planning Commission initially heard the application request on January 18, 2017 and voted to continue the item to February 1, 2017 to enable the applicant time to meet with Downtown Santa Monica, Inc. and the Downtown Neighborhood Association. On February 1, 2017, the Planning Commission voted 4-2 (one absent) to approve Conditional Use Permit 16ENT-0128.  The approval included conditions and modifications to the applicant’s request and staff’s recommended conditions. In the Commission’s deliberations, t here was a significant amount of discussion regarding the restaurant’s independent ownership and use from the Hotel, the need for a vibrant pedestrian oriented use within the unfinished space, and discussion of potential impacts related to the Shore Hotel’s conditions of approval as a limited amenity hotel. In addition to conditions that ensured the separation of the restaurant from the hotel, typical operational conditions, and limitations on hours of alcohol service, the Commission added that if the restaurant were to go out of business, the Conditional Use Permit (CUP) would only transfer to a new restaurant if the successor operator demonstrated that it is legally separate and distinct from the hotel operator and that the operation will be separate and distinct from the hotel.  The Commission also required that there be a report summarizing the restaurant’s compliance with conditions of approval after one year and again after seven years of operation if residential development occurred within 500 feet of the site. 	 Proposed Project Operation / Hours of Alcohol Service The applicant, Full of Flavor LLC., is requesting a CUP to allow alcohol service in conjunction with a Type-47 (On-Sale General, Bona Fide Eating Place) alcohol license at a proposed full-service restaurant , the Avery .  This independently owned and operated restaurant would occupy the vacant the 2nd Street fronting ground floor space (Space B) of approximately 3, 306 square feet . An additional outdoor dining area of 306 square feet is also requested. The proposed dining area totals 102 seats including 92 indoor seats, a private dining area, 12 bar seats (counted with indoor seats), and 10 outdoor seats, as depicted in the floor plan shown in Figure 1.  Figure 1: Proposed Floor Plan  The outdoor dining area extends approximately 6’ from the building façade within the subject site, adjacent to a 10’ public sidewalk along 2nd Street.   Dining Area/ Private Dining 1,958 sf 80 seats Kitchen/Service Area 887sf N/A Bar Area 155 sf 12 Outdoor Patio 306 sf as conditioned 10 seats   The restaurant would function as a full-service restaurant for sit-down breakfast, lunch and dinner meal service and provide patrons the opportunity to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages Sun day through Saturday - 7  A . M . to 2 A. M . The applicant’s rational e for the extended hours request is their wish to have consistent hours of alcohol and food service.  Vehicular Parking & Circulation Vehicular and pedestrian access to the restaurant is via 2 nd Street. However, p arking at the Shore Hotel is accessed from Ocean Avenue, a block west of the site, for which there is valet parking 24 hours/7 days a week. The Shore Hotel currently provides 210 standard and compact parking spaces and 70 additional non-required tandem spaces on-site within 4 subterranean parking levels. All of the parking on-site is valet-operated 24-hours daily.  With the addition of the proposed restaurant, the required parking for all uses on the site is 223 spaces, resulting in a short fall of 13 spaces. However, with the valet operation in place, the tandem spaces may be utilize d to support the restaurant’s off-street parking requirement. As provided in Condition #10 of the proposed Statement of Official Action, valet parking shall be provided to restaurant patrons during all hours of restaurant operations.  Hotel Entitlements and Limited Amenity Condition s of Approval The City Council’s approval of the Shore Hotel development requires the hotel to operate as a limited amenity facility per Condition #10 of DR 05-007, CUP 05-009 and VAR 06-018.  As specified in the project conditions of approval, the hotel operator may provide an exercise room, breakfast/meeting room, swimming and spa pools.  Additionally, a hotel restaurant/bar, conference facilities, spa, florist, lounge or similar amenities typically found in more luxury hotels may be determined by the Director of Planning to constitute hotel amenit ies resulting in a change in character that would be subject to Planning Commission approval.  However, this condition does not apply to the two restaurant spaces (Spaces A and B) that were planned with the hotel’s property fronting on 2nd  Street and Ocean Avenue if these venues are operated as separate and distinct entities from the hotel and the hotel operations. Space A is currently occupied by Blue Plate Taco and has an approved alcohol CUP with conditions that it be operated separate and distinct from hotel operations.  As stated in Condition #3 of the proposed Statement of Official Action, t he hours of operation for the full-service restaurant in Space B would be 7:00 a.m. – 2:00 a.m. seven days a week with complete closure by 3 a.m.  As detailed in the Planning Commission staff report, a number of restaurants have recently been approved with similar hours D owntown and therefore, the hours are appropriate due to lack of nearby residents living within the area.  Conditions # 1-10 in the proposed Statement of Official Action  are intended to reduce the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding area and ensure that the restaurant operate s independently of the hotel and include the following: ·  102 seats (92 indoor 12 of which may be located along a bar counter) and 10 outdoor seats. ·  Alcoholic beverages orders shall cease 30 minutes prior to restaurant closure, or no later than the closing of the associated food service of the establishment, whichever is first. ·  No restaurant delivery to the hotel guestrooms shall occur unless delivery is offered as part of the restaurant’s typical operations. ·  No service orders to the restaurant shall be processed through the hotel. ·  No restaurant charges shall be included on the hotel bill. ·  The operation of the restaurant shall be separate and distinct from the operation of the Shore Hotel. The approval of Conditional Use Permit 16ENT-0218 (“CUP”) is applicable solely to Full of Flavor, LLC, and is not applicable to the owners of the Shore Hotel or any of their successors in interest.   Therefore, the CUP shall terminate automatically upon the termination of the operation of the restaurant by Full of Flavor, LLC, unless a proposed successor operator and/or tenant is approved in writing by the Planning Director prior to the commencement of any new operation or tenancy at 1530 2 nd Street that requires a Type 47 alcohol license.  In furtherance of achieving the objectives of this condition, the Planning Director may withhold approval until such time as the successor operator and/or tenant provides documentation to substantiate (i) that it is legally separate and distinct from the owners of the Shore Hotel and (ii) that its operation at 1530 2 nd Street will be separate and distinct from the Shore Hotel. ·  Pursuant to SMMC Section 9.41.080(B), after the proposed restaurant has been operational for one (1) year, and then again after seven (7) years of operation if there has been residential development within 500 feet of the site, the applicant shall provide to the City a report summarizing the restaurant’s compliance with these conditions of approval.  After submittal of the compliance report, if staff determines that there have violations of these conditions of approval, staff shall submit the compliance report to the Planning Commission as an information item to enable the Planning Commission to determine whether a public hearing is necessary.  Upon review of the compliant report at this public hearing, the Planning Commission may add or revise terms and conditions to the extent necessary to ensure effective conditions of approval. ·  Valet parking shall be provided to restaurant patrons during all hours of restaurant operations.  Neighborhood Compatibility Santa Monica’s Downtown functions as the City’s greatest concentration of commerce, retail, dining, transit, and entertainment. The C3 District is within the downtown and is intended to maintain and enhance the downtown area. The neighborhood provides a variety of commercial, residential, cultural, and recreational opportunities and complementary uses that generate activity during both daytime and evening hours. The surrounding developments on 2nd Street include a variety of use s , in cl uding Santa Monica Place, a new ly renovated P arking S tructure #6 with expanded ground floor pedestrian uses, Hotel Carmel, retail, and dining. The proposed ground floor restaurant of the Shore Hotel fronts 2nd Street, and since the hotel’s opening, the space has remained a  shell space that has occasionally been used for seminars and events .  The proposed restaurant use will enliven 2nd Street by offering a full-service dining option with alcohol service.  The impacts associated with this type of use are generally associated with noise and circulation issues. The proposed valet condition will address the patron’s ability to park near the site and the outdoor dining area is minimal with only a small area outside the building on private property available for outdoor dining.   It is not anticipated that the alcohol service will be inconsistent with other alcohol service establishments within the downtown, or that the use would negatively impact residential uses that may be near the proposed restaurant.  General Plan Consistency The proposed use is consistent with Goal and Policies established in the Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE). The subject site is located within the Downtown Core Land Use District, which serves as the City’s center of transportation, commerce, and entertainment. LUCE Goal D1 envisions the Downtown Core as a premier shopping, dining and entertainment destination for local and regional visitors. Policy D1.1 supports the creation of diverse local and regional serving retail and dining opportunities in the district. The subject CUP, as conditioned, would allow a new dining establishment an opportunity to function in a manner that is consistent with other dining facilities and alcohol outlets in the Downtown. LUCE Goal D7 supports the district’s balanced mix of uses that reinforce the greatest concentration of activity in the City and Policy D7.1 encourages a broad mix of uses that create dynamic activity in both the daytime and evening hours. The full-service restaurant with incidental alcohol service will provide meal service to residents and visitors during day and evening hours.  Appeal Summary On February 14, 2017, the appellant, UNITE HERE Local 11, filed an appeal of the Planning Commission’s approval of Conditional Use Permit 16ENT-0128 . The full text of the appeal is presented in Attachment C of this report. The appellant’s appeal statement is summarized below.  1.  The restaurant could impact price and accessibility of the hotel to working people and is not consistent with a limited amenity hotel.  2.  There are unresolved accusations against the hotel owner regarding violation of existing Conditional Use Permits.  3.  There is pending litigation between the Shore Hotel and the Coastal Commission which should be resolved prior to approving a CUP for Space B.  4.  CUP Finding #3 cannot assert that “the proposed restaurant tenancy and alcohol service will operate as a standalone operation separate and distinct from the hotel”.  5.  CUP Finding #4, that the proposed use is compatible with any of the land uses presently on the subject parcel if the present land uses are to remain cannot be made because the pending Shore Hotel and Coastal Commission litigation puts doubt on the continued operation of the hotel.  6.  CUP C onditions of Approval #2-4, #5, #8 and # 9 specifying extended hours of operation, additional seats, delivery service by the restaurant if such service is included in their operations, termination of successor operators under certain conditions and subsequent compliance hearings are moot due to the pending litigation and the inconsistency of the Shore Hotel to operate under the current hotel conditions of approval.  Appeal Analysis Ordinance No. 2522 (CCS) requires that the provisions of the 1988 Zoning Ordinance, as amended, apply to the properties located in the Downtown Community Plan area until such time as the Plan is adopted and becomes effective . The Council, in its de novo review of this appeal, must determine whether the proposed project meets the following findings for a Conditional Use Permit pursuant to SMMC Section 9.04.20.12.040 : (a)  The proposed use is one conditionally permitted within the subject district and complies with all of the applicable provisions of the "City of Santa Monica Comprehensive Land Use and Zoning Ordinance". (b)  The proposed use would not impair the integrity and character of the district in which it is to be established or located. (c)  The subject parcel is physically suitable for the type of land use being proposed. (d)  The proposed use is compatible with any of the land uses presently on the subject parcel if the present land uses are to remain. (e)  The proposed use would be compatible with existing and permissible land uses within the district and the general area in which the proposed use is to be located. (f)  There are adequate provisions for water, sanitation, and public utilities and services to ensure that the proposed use would not be detrimental to public health and safety . (g)  Public access to the proposed use shall be adequate . (h)  The physical location or placement of the use on the site is compatible with and relates harmoniously to the surrounding neighborhood. (i)  The proposed use is consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies of the General Plan . (j)  The proposed use would not be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, convenience, or general welfare. (k)  The proposed use conforms precisely to the applicable performance standards contained in Subchapter 9.04.12 , Section 9.04.12.010 and special conditions outlined in Subchapter 9.04.14 , Section 9.04.14.010. (l)  The proposed use will not result in an over concentration of such uses in the immediate vicinity,  Council must also make the following a dditional Alcohol Outlet findings for the dispensing of alcoholic beverages pursuant to SMMC Section 9.04.10.18.030 : (a)  The proposed use will not adversely affect the welfare of neighborhood residents in a significant manner. (b)  The proposed use will not contribute to an undue concentration of alcohol outlets in the area. (c)  The proposed use will not detrimentally affect nearby neighborhoods considering the distance of the alcohol outlet to residential buildings, churches, schools, hospitals, playgrounds, park, and other existing alcohol outlets. (d)  The proposed use is compatible with existing and potential uses within the general area. (e)  Traffic and parking congestion will not result. (f)  The public health, safety, and general welfare are protected. (g)  No harm to adjacent properties will result. (h)  The objectives of the General Plan are secured.  The Council may uphold the decision of the Planning Commission or grant the appeal, in whole or in part, based upon these findings.  1.  The appellant’s first point is to assert that the restaurant could impact the price and accessibility of the hotel to working people as a limited amenity to the hotel. The restaurant is being operated by a separate and distinct entity from the hotel and is not permitted to be a hotel amenity.  Further, the CUP is only being request ed  for alcohol service in conjunction with restaurant operations. Condition # 8  requires the separation of hotel and restaurant operations and therefore , the proposed restaurant is no more an amenity of the hotel than any other nearby restaurant.  2.  The appellant ’s second point states that the Shore Hotel has outstanding violations with respect to their existing Conditional Use Permits. N otwithstanding that the Shore Hotel and the applicant’s request for an alcohol CUP in Space B are unrelated, t he Code Compliance Division has previously investigated the Shore Hotel’s possible violations of existing CUPs and determined that the hotel is in compliance. The applicant making the request for the proposed alcohol CUP for Space B is not associated with the ownership of the Shore Hotel.  Further the restaurant is being operated separate and distinct from hotel operations.  3.  The appellant ’s third point states that pending litigation between the Shore Hotel and the Coastal Commission should be resolved prior to approving a CUP for Space B. City staff contacted Coastal Commission representatives staff regarding the pending litigation and was informed that the pending litigation should not impact the CUP for  alcohol service by a third party applicant in Space B .  Staff was also informed that the trail trial is currently scheduled for June, 2017. As previously mentioned, the applicant requesting the alcohol CUP for Space B is not an affiliate to the Shore Hotel ownership.  The restaurant in Space B is being operated separately from the hotel and would be required to obtain separate approvals from the Coastal Commission prior to commencing operations.  4.  The appellant ’s fourth point contends that CUP Finding #3 (parcel is physically suitable for the proposed use) cannot be met because the hotel and restaurant will not operate as separate entities. This particular finding addresses the physical suitability of the parcel for the proposed use.  The tenant space where the restaurant with alcohol service is proposed is on the ground floor of the hotel building with frontage on 2 nd Street.  The tenant space has a pedestrian entrance on 2 nd Street and is suitable for accommodating the proposed restaurant use with alcohol service.  The appellant’s contention that the hotel and restaurant will not operate as separate entities cannot be substantiated.  The City has received no evidence that the restaurant will operate as anything but a separate tenant of the hotel. In addition, as noted above, conditions of approval have been included to ensure that the hotel and restaurant operate as separate entities.  5.  The appellant ’s fifth point contends that CUP Finding #4 (compatibility with on-site uses) cannot be met because the hotel is in litigation with the Coastal Commission over its Coastal Development Permit and is unsure if the hotel will continue to operate. As noted in the response to the appellant’s third point of appeal, City staff contacted Coastal Commission representatives regarding the subject application for a CUP for alcohol service in Space B and was informed that the pending litigation would not preclude the approval of a CUP for the proposed restaurant in Space B by a third party applicant . As previously mentioned, the applicant requesting the alcohol CUP for Space B is unrelated to the operation or ownership of the Shore Hotel. Furthermore , the issuance of the CUP would not alter the respective positions of the Coastal Commission or the Shore Hotel in the pending litigation.  Even if the litigation were to result in a termination of hotel operations, such termination would remain a private matter as between the Shore Hotel (as landlord ) and the CUP applicant (as tenant).  Furthermore, t he restaurant in Space B is being operated separately from the hotel and would be required to obtain separate approvals from the Coastal Commission prior to commencing operations.  6.  The appellant ’s sixth point states that Conditions #2 and #3 allow for more seats and extended hours of alcohol service than the previously approved CUP for the subject space (Space B) and those hours for Blue Plate Taco (Space A). The request for a CUP for alcohol service in Space B is a new application that does not rely on previous approvals.  In recommending the hours of alcohol service, staff reviewed the approved alcohol service hours for other Downtown restaurants in addition to assessing proximity of residential land uses that could be impacted by alcohol service at the restaurant.  Based on the primarily commercial land uses in the immediate surroundings and recently approved alcohol service hours, the 7AM-2AM limitation was approved by the Planning Commission.  7.  The appellant ’s seventh point  states that Condition #5 provides a loophole for room service by the hotel. This condition permits the restaurant to deliver food “to go” to the rooms as they may to any other off-site location and is not related to amenities offered by the hotel.  8.  The appellant ’s eighth point states that Condition #8 does little to prevent the restaurant as a hotel amenity. This condition requires that the hotel and restaurant must operate separately by expressly stating that the CUP terminates with termination of the restaurant’s operations by the applicant or any approved successors.  A ny successor operator of the restaurant must provide the Director of Planning evidence to substantiate (i) that it is legally separate and distinct from the owners of the Shore Hotel and (ii) that its operation at 1530 2 nd Street will be separate and distinct from the Shore Hotel.  9.  The appellant ’s ninth point states that Condition #9, which requires a compliance report on the restaurant’s conformance with the CUP conditions, will not lead to successful enforcement given the prior allegations of CUP violations by the hotel. Condition #9 only addresses the restaurant’s compliance with the alcohol CUP conditions of approval and does not involve the hotel operator at all. Compliance with the alcohol CUP conditions of approval is the responsibility of the restaurant operator.  Applicant’s Statement The applicant has provided, as requested by the City Attorney, legal documentation to demonstrate their operation as a separate and distinct entity from the Shore Hotel ownership.  Additionally, Full of Flavor LLC asserts the dispute between UNITE HERE Local 11 and the Shore Hotel is unfairly impacting their proposed business.  They cite the following incidents to demonstrate their findings:  ·  Members of the public acknowledged the proposed restaurant operator is a third party entity during the public testimony. ·  The proposed CUP conditions are consistent with Blue Plate Taco (restaurant Space A) that require the restaurant serving alcohol operate independently from Shore Hotel ownership; ·  Unite Here Local 11 makes references to the Shore Hotel (ownership) as being in litigation.  The applicant is not part of the litigation and appellant is seeking to combine the validity of the Hotel’s coastal permit with the pending CUP application.  The applicant is in agreement with the proposed conditions of approval including number of seats, hours of operation, delivery service, potential cessation of the CUP upon a change of ownership and possible compliance hearings before the Planning Commission if residential development occurs within 500 feet of the site. The applicant supplied two letters of project support via the DTSM Downtown Santa Monica Inc. and the Downtown Neighborhood Association prior to the February 1, 2017 hearing. Correspondence was received from the public between the Planning Commission’s January 18, 2017 public hearing and the February 1, 2017 meeting supporting UNITE HERE Local 11’s arguments for denying the alcohol CUP .  The correspondence also alleged bad faith operations of the Shore Hotel with respect to their organization, consistency of the Hotel’s approved operational conditions and the relationship with UNITE HERE Local 11 and the hotel’s employees. This request is exempt from the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), pursuant to Section 15301 (Class 13 – Existing Facilities), of the State Implementation Guidelines as the project involves interior improvements to an existing building to establish a new restaurant with on-site sale of beer, wine and distilled spirits. As an alternative to the staff recommendation, the Council may consider the following with respect to the pending appeal if supported by the full evidentiary record:  1.  Approve the appeal (17ENT-0016) submitted by the appellant and deny Conditional Use Permit (16ENT-0128). 2.  Articulate revised findings and/or conditions to Approve OR Deny the subject appeal. There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of the recommended action. 	\N	17
79	Introduction and First Reading of an Ordinance Amending the Lobbying Regulations	Records & Elections Services Department	The lobbying regulations have been in effect since September 19, 2016, at which time lobbyists began registering with the City Clerk's Office.  Upon adoption of the ordinance regulating lobbying, the Council requested staff return with an update on the lobbyist registration process.  Based on staff’s experience in implement ing of Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 4.85, staff recommends the proposed modifications listed below to clarify definitions, registration and reporting requirements, and exemptions (Attachment 1) . 	On March 22, 2016 , the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 2511 regulating lobbying (Attachment 2) .  The ordinance was set to become effective 180 days from its adoption , on September 19, 2016, and Council requested staff come back with suggested improvements and/or expansion in the future.  On August 9, 2016, the Council adopted Resolution No. 10983 (Attachment 3) establishing lobbyist registration fees  and regulations (Attachment 4) .  Lobbyists are required to register annually, and no later than ten days after qualifying as a lobbyist.  Amendments must be filed within ten days of any change in the information required to be disclosed on the lobbyist registration.  Since its inception, on September 19 , 2016, 46 lobbyists have registered with the City Clerk's Office, with 52 amendments to those registrations . 	  S taff has considered comments submitted from local lobbyists and organizations and , based on experience and current practice, staff recommends the following amendments to Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 4.58.  Proposed Amendments to Lobbyist Ordinance ·  Clarify the types of “action” covered under the lobbyist definition  Questions were raised as to what constitutes a legislative or administra tive action.  Staff recommends the definition of “Lobbyist” in Section 4.85.010 be modified as follows: “Lobbyist” means any individual who receives economic consideration as the employee, representative , or contractor of a person or entity other than the City of Santa Monica for the purpose of influencing a legislative or administrative  City  actions.  For the purpose of this Chapter, “Lobbyist” does not include City contractors or those seeking City contracts through bids and proposals.  ·  Clarify the definition of “Official”   Staff recommends modifying the definition of “Official” as follows:  “Official” means any person who is: (a)   Elected to the City Council; (b)  Appointed by the City Council to serve o n a board or commission or as a City employee Planning Commissioner, Architectural Review Board Member, Landmarks Commissioner, Personnel Board Member, City Manager, City Attorney, City Clerk ; (c)   A City employee appointed to serve as a director of a City department; (d)  A City employee who makes direct recommends to a person listed in subsection (a), (b) or (c) or who has decision-making authority as to contracts, permits or other governmental approvals or benefits.  Any City employee who is required to file a Statement of Economic Int erest.  ·  Clarify registration and reporting requirements. Section 4.85.020 outlines the registration and reporting requirements.  Based on current practices, staff recommends amending the information required on the registration form.  Additionally, this section could distinguish what constitutes an amendment or addendum.  Since increased transparency is a goal of the lobbyist regulations, staff distinguished between an amendment and an addendum.  An amendment would be required to be filed when a new client is represented by the lobbyist.  An addendum allows the lobbyist to update its existing registration such as to indicate new contacts with City officials on behalf of existing clients.  Finally, staff recommends adding a section regarding exemptions to the registration and reporting requirements to reflect Council’s direction exempting lobbying at public meetings and current practices implemented based on discussions with local lobbyists and community groups.  Staff recommends the following: Section 4.85.020 - Registration and reporting requirements. A.  A  Lobbyist  shall  annually  register  with  the  City  Clerk,  no  later  than  ten  days  after qualifying  as  a  Lobbyist  under  this  chapter,  on  a  registration  form  provided  by  the  City, and  shall thereon  disclose: (a)  name Lobbyist/Lobbyist Firm ; (b)  Business  street  and  / mailing  address; (c)  E-mail  address; (d)  Telephone  number; (e)  The  names  of  all  owners  of  the  Lobbyist's  business  if  the  business  is  a  sole proprietorship  or  partnership  of  less  than  5  members; (f)  Names of each individual L obbyist; (g)  A description  of  the  nature  of  the  business  entity  or organization; (h)  The  name,  business  address  and  phone  number  of  each  client  receiving lobbying  services; (i)  The  nature  of  each  client's  business; (j)  A brief  description  of  the  governmental  decision  that  the  Lobbyist seeks  to influence  on  each  client's  behalf  and  the  names  of  the  Officials  the  Lobbyist  has  contacted on  each  client's  behalf. (k)  The  name  of  each  person  employed  or  retained  by  the  Lobbyist  to  engage in  lobbying  activities  on  each  client's  behalf; and (l)  The  date,  amount,  and  description  of  any  payment  made  to,  or  on  behalf  of any  City  official  or  member  of  an  official's  family.  Payments  to  be  disclosed  include  gifts, meals,  fees,  salaries  and  any  other  form  of  compensation  or  remuneration,  but  do  not include  campaign  contributions.   B.  A Lobbyist shall file an amendment to his or her registration and reporting form within ten days of representation of a new client.  An addendum must be filed within ten days of  any change in the information required to be disclosed on the form related to existing clients.  and Lobbyists shall report the names of all Officials contacted about a governmental decision prior to any public hearing on that decision C.  The following are exempt from this Chapter: (a)  Persons who attempt s to influence government action are limited to appearing at public meetings or preparing, processing, or submitting writings for consideration of use at public meetings if their communications are part of the public record; and (b)  Persons representing themselves in attempting to obtain decisions relating to their own properties or business; and (c)  Persons whose communications relate solely to a memorandum of understanding or collective bargaining agreement between the City and an employee organization . 	\N	17
80	Policies for City Boards, Commissions, Committees, Task Forces and Regional Advisory Boards	Records & Elections Services Department	The City of Santa Monica values public input and, therefore, has established boards, commissions, committees and task forces to provide recommendations to the City Council.  Comprehensive, clear guidelines will assist the volunteers in adequately representing the City.  The policies and procedures for the City's boards, commissions, committees and task forces are contained in various City Council resolutions.  In an effort to create a comprehensive set of guidelines, staff recommends the City Council adopt the proposed resolution. 	Santa Monica residents are committed to participating in local government and the democratic process.  Public participation in the City's boards, commissions, committees and task forces ensures thorough representation and input.  The 171 members on the City’s 24 active boards, commissions, committees and task forces provide advice and recommendations on the following topics: Airport, Architectural Review, Arts, Audit, Building and Fire-Life Safety, Clean Beaches and Ocean Parcel Tax, Disabilities, Downtown Santa Monica, Environment, Housing, Landmarks, Library, Personnel, Planning, Recreation and Parks, Redevelopment, Santa Monica Pier, Santa Monica Travel and Tourism, Senior Community, Social Services, Status of Women, and Urban Forest.  The process and policies surrounding the City's boards, commissions, committees and task forces are currently contained in three different resolutions - Resolution Numbers 6751 (CCS), 9088 (CCS) and 10920 (CCS).  The Council established provisions for reimbursements of expenses of members of boards and commissioners when it adopted Resolution No. 6751 (CCS) on September 20, 1983.  Additionally, Resolution No. 9088 (CCS), adopted September 25, 1996, sets forth procedures for making appointments to City boards and commissions.  The policies for City boards, commissions, task forces, committees and regional advisory boards were most recently updated on October 27, 2015.  Resolution No. 10920 (CCS) reiterated the existing policies and effectuated ethics training requirements, established term limits, and extended the rule of limiting membership to one board/commission at any given time. 	 After review of the existing regulations related to boards, commissions, committees and task forces, and based on current practices, staff recommends the Council adopt one consolidating resolution that would contain the existing regulations regarding term limits, membership limitations on one body, biennial review of agendas and minutes, annual dinner, written communications, conduct of meetings, attendance, reimbursement of expenses and ethics training.  In addition to consolidating the three resolutions, minor modifications to reflect current practices are proposed.  The proposed resolution outlines the application process for appointments.  In the past, concerns were raised to Council over the boards , commissions, committees and task forces, reviewing, deliberating and providing recommendations to the City Council regarding applicants.  Based on Council direction, staff recommends the addition of Section 1.D. , indicating that the City Council will not accept recommendations regarding a ppointees for board, commission, committee , or task force vacancies.  Section 1.F. adds information on the City's process for complying with Government Code Section 59472 (commonly known as the Maddy Act), related to noticing requirements for Local Appointments .  In order to clarify allowable uses for City funds, a new Section 5 is proposed indicating such funds are restricted to the following: Participation or sponsorship fees for local events, dues/memberships to other organizations that align with board, c ommission , committee, and task force goals, conferences/ training that aligns with board, commi ssion , committee, or task force goals, costs related to commission materials, including printing of materials, business cards, pos tage, giveaways for events of minor / nominal value , supplies for C ity -spons ored events, food for City retreats, and accommodation services such as signing and closed captioning.  Policies regarding written communications are contained within Section 8 of the r esolution.  In an effort to ensure compliance with the Brown Act and transact City b usiness through City email, additional language is proposed to require all City-appointed board, commission, committee, and task force members to utilize their City-issued email address for City business.  An additional provision was added as Section 10 .B. to allow prolonged absences to be excused upon approval of the board, commission, committee or task force and Section 10.D. was modified to have the City Clerk report attendance to the City Council on a bi-annual basis.  	\N	17

83	Amendment to the Resolution Adopting Rules of Conduct for the Audit Subcommittee	Finance Department	On May 9, 2017, Council adopted R esolution No. 11042 adopting Rules of Conduct for the Audit Subc ommittee of the Santa Monica City Council.  The Rules required the presence of all three Council Committee members for a quorum of the Audit Subcommittee . Staff recommends modifying the rules to define quorum as a majority of members and at least two Council Committee members present for a meeting to occur. The proposed language in the amended resolution (Attachment A) clarifies rules and provides flexibility in the management of the Audit Subcommittee . 	At its May 9 , 2017 meeting, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 11042 adopting Rules of Conduct for the Audit Subcommittee of the City Council .  Section 2 of the adopted resolution states that “A majority of Committee Members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except to adjourn.  All three Council Committee members must be present for a meeting to occur.” 	 A ccording to the current  Resolution , all three Council Committee members must be present for a meeting to occur. S taff seeks to modify this language in recognition of scheduling challenges and to ensure Subcommittee business moves forward in a timely manner .  Staff anticipates that this change will continue to allow for an adequate level of Council member participation in the Subcommittee while minimiz ing the need for postponements and cancellations and allowing the Audit Subcommittee to receive regular reports of findings and provide regular direction to the City’s internal and external auditors. 	\N	18

85	Civic Center Multipurpose Sports Field Feasibility Study and Economic Analysis Findings and Options for Next Steps	Community & Cultural Services	Staff has continued working to advance a multipurpose sports field at the Civic Center per Council’s direction, including exploring a potential partnership project with the Santa Monica-Malibu School District (SMMUSD) that would develop a permanent multipurpose sports field with a softball field overlay and two levels of subterranean parking. City and District staff have come to an initial agreement on proposed terms for a joint use parking and field agreement and an economic analysis was conducted to determine what each agency’s equitable pro rata financial contribution to the project would be , as well as immediate and long-term financial impacts s hould the project move forward. Given the financial impacts identified by the economic analysis, staff recommends Council consider several options and alternatives and provide direction accordingly. 	On February 9, 2016 (Attachment A), staff presented the Civic Working Group Final Report and proposed next steps to Council. Council directed staff to explore the possibility of placing a temporary field at the corner of 4 th  St reet and Pico B oulevard , to work with partners such as SMMUSD and Santa Monica College on funding options and to return to Council in May 2016 with cost estimates. At the May 24, 2016 Council budget study session (Attachment B), funding totaling $200,000 was identified in FY 2016-17 as part of the FY 2016-18 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for design of the field.  Following considerable discussion and in response to public testimony, Council adopted a motion directing staff to earmark funds for the construction of the Civic Center multi-purpose sports field as identified in the adopted 2005 Civic Center Specific Plan and to provide quarterly updates to Council on the status of the project to ensure it moves forward as quickly as possible. In addition to the aforementioned $200,000 budgeted in FY 2016-17 for the design of the t emporary Civic Center sports field , the five-year CIP budget plan for FY 2016-21 also includes the use of $3.25 million in reserve funds for construction of the Civic Center sports field in FY 2018-19.  On October 25, 2016 (Attachment C), staff presented a quarterly update on the project at a Council study session. Following the presentation, Council directed staff to initiate a discussion with Coastal Commission staff regarding the temporary sports field project on the Civic Center parking lot and its resulting removal of approximately 600 spaces of surface parking; continue discussions with SMMUSD staff regarding a potential partnership project in the Civic Center to include subterranean parking and a permanent multi-purpose sports field with associated permanent amenities; and to reissue the Request for Proposals (RFP) to a wider range of potential firms for the design of the temporary field in an effort to identify a fee proposal that was aligned with the $200,000 budget in the FY 2016-17 CIP budget.  Staff proceeded per Council’s direction and issued an Information Item on January 17, 2017  to provide Council with an interim progress update (Attachment D).  S taff returned to Council on February 28, 2017  to deliver an update on discussions with Coastal Commission staff, ongoing negotiations with SMMUSD, and a plan to award the feasibility and concept portion of the design contract to RJM Design Group Inc. (Attachment E). Council directed staff to continue negotiations with SMMUSD regarding the partnership project and set a definitive deadline of June 2017 to either reach an agreement or end negotiations and proceed with advancing the temporary multipurpose sports field without subterranean parking. Council also directed staff to develop a comprehensive plan for the sports field to ensure future needs of the Civic Auditorium were considered and the field would not impede its rehabilitation. 	The Recreation and Parks Commission considered the temporary and permanent multipurpose Civic Center sports field options at its June 15, 2017 meeting and approved a motion to recommend to Council that it direct staff to move forward with development of the temporary field option.  Feasibility Analysis and Design Concepts An interdepartmental team of City and SMMUSD staff conducted intensive discussions and collaborated with consultants from RJM Design to determine the feasibility of two options for a multipurpose sports field at the Civic Center: a temporary field with no new parking spaces added and a permanent field with subterranean parking.  Option 1: Temporary Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center The temporary field option (Exhibit 1) would feature a regulation size multipurpose sports field at grade with dimensions comparable to the existing field at Airport Park (225’ x 360’). The feasibility analysis determined a softball field overlay could be accommodated on the site with a 225’ centerfield line and a 200’ foul line. Due to site constraints, the softball infield would be composed of synthetic turf rather than the traditional clay material to allow soccer and other sports to be played on the field. Other amenities would include lighting, fencing and containment netting around the perimeter of the field (approximate combined height of 26’) , a portable restroom trailer, temporary storage space, temporary spectator seating, a moveable homerun fence, and chain-link dugouts and bullpens. Access to the temporary field site would be provided through the existing Civic Center Drive and Main Street parking lot entrances. The existing emergency ingress and egress at Pico Boulevard would be retained. This option would present significant challenges due to the amount of surface parking displaced. A comprehensive parking study of the area surrounding the Civic Center, including the Downtown, would be needed to demonstrate that the loss of parking would not impede coastal access in order to secure approval of a Coastal Development Permit from the California Coastal Commission . Additionally, City staff , Santa Monica High School (Samohi) faculty and students , and visitors to the Civic C enter  who currently park in the lot would be displaced and alternative arrangements would need to be considered. The Courthouse would also be affected by the displacement of parking and its administration has expressed serious concerns with the project as proposed as well as with other upcoming development proj ects within the Civic Center (further detailed below ), citing the need for employee parking and accessible parking for patrons visiting the court to serve jury duty and seek legal assistance . Furthermore, the significant parking loss could likely  impact future reuse of the Civic Auditorium as prospective private partners may consider the venue to be an unfavorable investment without sufficient convenient parking .  Based on the feasibility study and concept design, it is estimated the temporary multipurpose sports field would cost approximately $8.6 million. This estimate includes the aforementioned amenities, projected future cost escalation, and an allowance for hazardous material removal and remediation. The estimate is considerably higher than previous estimates as it includes costs associated with adding the softball field overlay, contingency for design development, and site constraint construction cost premiums that were not originally included in earl ier project cost estimates. Additionally, the construction market has experienced a period of inflated costs due to a surge in demand and a shortage of labor , resulting in increased escalation projections .  If this option were selected, next steps would include: ·  Environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) , amending the Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) as needed, c ompleting design and construction documents with  RJM Design to definitively determine funding needs  for the FY 2018-2020 CIP budget . Staff would return to Council as necessary to award a contract for this work. ·  Conducting the aforementioned parking study in preparation for Coastal Commission review at an estimated cost of $ 250,000 ( currently unbudgeted ) .  Undertaking and managing this unanticipated step would require a considerable amount of staff time and would divert staff resources from other efforts. Staff would return to Council as necessary to identify funds and award a contract to a parking consultant following a competitive selection process. ·  Discussions with SMMUSD to determine whether they would participate in the development of the temporary field and  provide funding to support the softball overlay for Samohi use ( a SMMUSD priority ) . ·  Discussions with Courthouse staff to address alternatives to lost surface parking both during and following construction.  Construction of the temporary field w ould potentially begin in March 2020 with the field opening in March 2021 . Given the need for a comprehensive parking study, Coastal Commission review and approval, appropriate environmental review , and amendment of the CCSP to address the field setback along Pico Boulevard , the timeline is a realistic estimate but could be subject to change if any unforeseen circumstances are encountered . Additionally, the timeline presents challenges given the schedules of other construction projects planned in the Civic Center, with projects overlapping at times from September 2017 through March 202 1 (see chart below). If these projects were constructed simultaneously, special attention would need to be pa id to ensure there is sufficient and safe workspace for each project zone and contractor laydown and storage areas would need to be accommodated on site  and/or off site . It is important to note excessive site constraints typically result in substantially higher construction costs and could result in project delays. Furthermore, with overlapping construction schedules, the Civic Center surface parking lot would be largely unavailable for an extended period .   City Services Building (CSB) September 2017 Spring  2020 Early Childhood Education Lab School (ECLS) Late 2017 / early 2018 Summer 2019 Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP) April 2019 October 2020 Temporary Multipurpose Sports Field March 2020 March  202 1   Option 2: Permanent Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center with Two Levels of Subterranean Parking The permanent sports field option (Exhibit 2) would also feature a regulation size soccer/multipurpose sports field at grade with dimensions comparable to the existing field at Airport Park and a softball field overlay with a 225’ centerfield line and a 200’ foul line. Similar to the temporary field option, the permanent softball infield would be composed of synthetic turf rather than the traditional clay material. Other amenities would include lighting, containment fencing and netting around the perimeter of the field (approximate combined height of 26’) , a permanent structure with restrooms and storage space, spectator seating, a moveable homerun fence, dugouts , and bullpens. Most notably, the permanent sports field option would provide approximately 700 – 725 spaces of subterranean parking on two levels. The parking structure would be accessed by a ramp adjacent to the westerly edge of the Early Childhood Lab School site (ECLS; formerly named the ECEC). To accommodate access to the parking structure ramp, Civic Center Drive would be extended through the parking lot to Main Street and the existing Main Street driveway would be permanently closed as contemplated by the CCSP. A bike connection from Pico Boulevard to Civic Center Drive would be included and would run between the westerly edge of the field and the Civic Auditorium.  The permanent field and parking structure has been estimated to cost approximately $95.4 million including escalation to the midpoint of construction and would include the aforementioned amenities and site improvements as well as earthwork and underground utility relocation to allow for two levels of subterranean parking. This estimate is higher than the previous estimate of $80 – 84 million and is attributed to recent marked inflation in the construction industry and inclusion of costs associated with the softball field overlay, contingency for design development, projected future cost escalation, site constraint construction cost premiums , and a higher allocation for relocation of underground utilities.  The cost to construct the parking garage is estimated to be approximately 91% of the total project cost.  Given the Council’s commitment to constructing additional sports fields as part of the Airport Park expansion and the City’s other capital project obligations, the City’s financial contribution of nearly $48 million towards construction of a permanent field with subterranean parking would need to  come from passage of a potential local general obligation bond i n November 2018.  This would require two-thirds voter approval and this project alone would constitute a large portion of the proposed citywide park funding measure .  On April 25, 2017 , Council directed staff to pursue the concept of a park funding measure , including conducting polling (Attachment F) . A decision by Council whether to put a measure on the November 2018 ballot would be required by August 2018.   If this option were selected, next steps would include completing the environmental analysis, ending RJM Design’s contract , and issuing an RFP for full design and engineering services for the permanent field and parking facility .  The RFP would incorporate the need for cost estimating services to more definitively estimate costs commensurate with design development. C onstruction of the permanent field could potentially begin in September 2020  and would be completed in approximately 24 months. Given the need for a comprehensive parking study, Coastal Commission review and approval, appropriate environmental review, and amendment of the CCSP to address the location of the sports field and subterranean parking (both are proposed for locations that differ from what was contemplated in the CCSP) , the timeline is a realistic estimate but could be subject to change if any unforeseen circumstances are encountered .  Moreover , as described below in the proposed partnership with SMMUSD, the Board of Education would need to determine if the permitting process would necessitate the involvement of the Division of the State Architect (DSA) since students may use the multipurpose sports field for physical education during school hours. It is important to note that DSA approval commonly takes 12 months from plan submittal to permit issuance , and could delay the project schedule as well as add further costs. Similar to the temporary field, the construction of the permanent field would take place during a time when the City Services Building an d the SWIP project are also under construction in the Civic Center area (see chart below).   City Services Building (CSB) September 2017 Spring  2020 Early Childhood Education Lab School (ECLS) Late 2017 / early 2018 Summer 2019 Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP) April 2019 October 2020 Permanent Multipurpose Sports Field with Parking September  2020 September  2022  Given that these projects are proposed concurrently and wo uld entail the temporary elimination of surface parking during overlapping construction periods, alternatives for replacement parking would need to be addressed for current Civic Center parking users.  Proposed Partnership with SMMUSD Since receiving direction from Council at the October 25, 2016 meeting, City staff have met regularly with SMMUSD staff to discuss and negotiate proposed terms that would be included in a joint use agreement for the permanent multipurpose sports field and subterranean parking structure. Should Council choose to move forward with th is option, proposed terms would be as follows: ·  The joint use a greement term would be 55 - years with a possible 45-year option to extend for use of the sports field . ·  To expedite the project SMMUSD would advance up to $4 million for design and pre-construction costs with the expectation that the City would reimburse SMMUSD for the City’s pro rata share of these costs as determined by the economic analysis ( discussed in the next section of the report ) , regardless of whether the City obtains local voter approval for bond financing . ·  The City and SMMUSD would each pay its pro rata share of construction costs with the understanding that construction of the project would be contingent upon local voter approval of the parks bond measure . ·  City would oversee and manage all aspects of the design and construction of the project through a collaborative process with SMMUSD participation. If DSA approval were determined to be a necessary component of the project, a  DSA inspector would need to be hired to be on site during construction. ·  City would retain land ownership and would own the sports field and subterranean parking structure. ·  City would oversee all operations and maintenance functions of the field and the subterranean parking structure. ·  SMMUSD would have exclusive use of the sports field Monday through Friday from 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm on operational school days. ·  SMMUSD would have exclusive rights to use a specified number of guaranteed parking spaces (anticipated need being 300 or fewer spaces) on Monday through Friday, reserved until 10:00 am, during the regular academic year (from the first day of instruction in August to the last day of instruction in June). After 10:00 am, the spaces not occupied would be made available to the general public; this would require additional management by staff and/ or with technology. The number of guaranteed parking spaces needed outside of the regular academic year would be far fewer. SMMUSD would not comp ensate the City for use of the  guaranteed parking spaces. ·  SMMUSD would receive an allocation of parking validation s for up to 25 special events, the exact amount of which has yet to be negotiated. ·  SMMUSD would agree to comply with the City's Transportation Demand Management Ordinance (SMMC Chapter 9.53) terms as a condition of exclusive use of the reserved parking spaces.   Economic Analysis The proposed terms for use of the permanent field and parking were considered in an economic analysis conducted by a team of consultants from Allan D. Kotin & Associates and Economic & Planning Systems (EPS). The economic analysis was commissioned to determine the overall financial feasibility of the permanent field project and an equitable basis for the City and SMMUSD to share costs associated with the project’s development (Attachment G ). The analysis examined the net cash flow of the existing condition and projected net cash flow of the temporary field for comparison. In addition to proposed field and parking usage plans , the economic analysis studied capital costs, projected maintenance , operational parking and field costs, projected revenues, and projected savings SMMUSD would achieve by avoiding building parking and a softball field on the Samohi campus.  Given these considerations, the analysis recommended the City and SMMUSD each contribute 50% of the total project costs , based upon the following assumptions: 1.  The City would realize all potential parking revenues by the e nd of the 55- year lease term; 2.  SMMUSD would complete its master plan to construct permanent parking on the Samohi campus by 2044; and 3.  SMMUSD would not be required to pay for use of any guaranteed  parking spaces in the Civic Center parking lot until its debt to finance the project is retired ( anticipated to occur by 2045 ) .  Given th e pro rata share, initial calculations, and current project cost estimates, development of a permanent field at the Civic Center would cost SMMUSD and the City approximately $47.7 million each. As noted previously, the City’s contribution would be dependent upon passage of a local bond measure. While it is premature to identify the ultimate size of such a local bond measure , it is clear  that a sizable portion of a future funding measure would be required to realize a project of this magnitude. Other priority park ne eds identified by the community such as the construction of the 12-acre expansion of Airport Park, the expansion of Memorial Park, and land acquisition for new parks, could potentially be deferred if sufficient funding is not available. If voters do not approve such a bond measure, the City would still need to reimburse SMMUSD for 50% of the design costs expended.  The economic analysis used the aforementioned pro rata share to determine the projected net cash flow for each party for the proposed 55 - year term of the joint use agreement ( 2020 through 2075 ) for a comparative analysis of existing conditions, a temporary sports field, and a permanent field with subterranean parking. The financial impacts of constructing either a temporary field or the permanent multipurpose sports field with subterranean parking on the Civic Center parking lot would be significant . If a permanent field were built, it is estimated the City’s net cash flow , assuming present value rates,  would be -$ 43.9 million over the full 55-year joint use agreement term. SMMUSD’s net cash flow would be -$ 4.8 million over the 55-year term of the agreement.  If a temporary field were built, it is estimated the City’s net cash flow would be -$16.7 million over a 55-year term. To ensure consistency, the economic analysis calculated SMMUSD’s net cash flow for the temporary field as well (-$6. 1 million over a 55-year term), with the assumption the City would finance 100% of the temporary project. However, it is important to note the City and SMMUSD staff have not discussed a potential partnership for the temporary field. Furthermore, because the temporary project eliminates most of the surface parking on the Civic Center lot , the project would not provide SMMUSD with guaranteed access to a predetermined number of parking spaces, which is arguably the most valuable financial benefit to SMMUSD of the proposed permanent field and parking partnership .  Alternatives The economic analysis illustrates the immediate and long-term financial impacts that both the permanent and temporary multipurpose sports field options would have on the City and SMMUSD. Given the significant investment and risk that would be required by both agencies, staff recommends Council consider the benefits and costs of each of the aforementioned scenarios as well as the following possible alternatives :  Alternative 1: Permanent Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center with One Level of Subterranean Parking One alternative is a permanent multipurpose sports field with the softball field overlay and one level (approximately 325 spaces) of subterranean parking. The preliminary estimated capital cost of this alternative is $60 million and the project timeline would be similar to that of the permanent field with two levels of parking. While the total capital cost is significantly lower than the permanent field with two levels of parking, there would also be fewer benefits. W ith only 325 parking spaces, the City would likely not be in a position to grant Samohi exclusive access to the number of spaces required to meet the needs of its faculty and staff, making this option less viable as a partnership with SMMUSD. Furthermore, fewer parking spaces would result in less parking availability for City and Courthouse staff and visitors.   Alternative 2: Temporary Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center with Offsite Parking Another alternative for consideration is the development of a temporary multipurpose sports field on the Civic Center site with parking leased offsite at a nearby location to accommodate parking needs of the Civic Center, Courthouse, Civic Auditorium, sports field, and Samohi. Staff would proceed with development of a field at the Civic Center and concurrently undertake a process to identify offsite parking, preferably within walk ing distance  of the Civic Center. This alternative would provide parking for the sports field and could meet the parking needs of the City, Courthouse, Samohi, and the Civic Auditorium and possibly, wholly or partially , address the Coastal Commission’s requirements. While this alternative could eliminate the need to build new subterranean parking and thereby save capital costs, the lease costs  would need to be negotiated and incurred at least in part by the variety of entities that would utilize the spaces . This option assumes proximate alternative parking sites could be identified within the dyna mic development environment and in consideration of future public and private projects near the Civic Center and the Downtown .   Alternative 3 : Defer Development of the Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center, Develop a Temporary Multipurpose Sports Field at Memorial Park, and Issue RFP for Civic Auditorium Operator The FY 2017-18 CIP Budget includes funding in the amount of $1.35 million for the development of a Master Plan for Memorial Park, which would include both the existing park and the 2.91-acre parcel that currently houses the Colorado Yards (also known as the f ormer Fisher Lumber site). C ouncil could consider directing staff to delay the master planning process and instead proceed with utilizing a portion of the Colorado Yards ,  combined with reconfiguring some of the existing park facilities and amenities , to design and construct a temporary multipurpose sports field at Memorial Park.  This multipurpose sports field would be used by Samohi and the community instead of developing the Civic Center field at this time (see Exhibit 3 below). Samohi spor ts teams currently utilize Memorial P ark’s baseball and softball fields as well as the indoor basketball courts. While this alternative would provide an additional multipurpose field centrally located in the City, it would not be adjacent to Samohi thereby requiring students to continue to travel to Memorial Park for practice and games.  Should this alternative be constructed, C ity staff would commit to assis t SMMUSD with identifying safe modes of transportation for student s from Samohi to the park , including exploring a possible direct shuttle option .  Following the design process and appropriate environmental review, c onstruction of the field at Memorial Park could potentially begin in July 2019 with the field opening in July 2020. The estimated project timeline would be a faster option than building the proposed temporary field at the Civic Center as a field at Memorial Park would not require a comprehensive parking study or an amendment to the CCSP, and would not require a Coastal Development Permit since it would not be in the coastal zone.  Staff would proceed concurrently with issuing an RFP for a field design consultant and an RFP for an operator of the Civic Auditorium, per Council’s directi on to staff on February 9, 2016 when the Civic Working Group’s Final Report was presented to Council (Attachment A). At that time, staff recommended Council focus on the Civic Auditorium by issuing an RFP for an operator and deferring decisions about the rest of the site until other planning processes had been completed and more information was available (e.g. Samohi Campus Plan, Downtown Community Specific Plan, Airport Park Expansion, and the possible exploration of ways to finance sports fields such as through public-private partnerships). Council directed staff to issue an RFP for an operator with the stipulation that proposals must be consistent with the ECLS as designed and the sports field as represented in the 2005 CCSP. The RFP has not been issued, pending information related to the design and ultimate direction of the sports field. Alternative 4: Defer Development of the Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center and Issue RFP for Civic Auditorium Operator As mentioned above, Council previously directed staff to issue an RFP for an operator with the stipulation that proposals must be consistent with the ECLS as designed and the sports field as represented in the 2005 CCSP. A decision to issue the RFP  now and defer the field would likely be supported by Civic Auditorium advocates and preservationists , but strongly opposed by the Samohi advocates and broader community that voiced an immediate need for a multipurpose sports field in close proximity to the high school, as well as a need to implement the plan as contemplated in the 2005 CCSP. This alternative would also not address the need for a softball field near Samohi.  Commission Action The Recreation and Parks Commission considered the temporary and permanent multipurpose Civic Center sports field options at its June 15, 2017 meeting and approved a motion to recommend to Council that it direct staff to move forward with development of the temporary field option. The economic analysi s had not been finalized at the time of the meeting and, therefore, the Commission’s decision was based upon the timeline and capital cost considerations. The Commission cited concerns with the permanent field’s overall capital cost as well as dissatisfaction with the possibility of utilizing a large percentage of a potential future parks bond to finance it.  Summary There are opportunities, challenges, and risks associated with each option and alternative considered in this report. Several options and alternatives provide field space in an ideal location but at great financial costs and with significant risks. Considering all factors, the least costly , least risky , and fastest  alternative would be to develop a temporary multipurpose sports field at Memorial Park. However, this approach would not meet the desires of the Samohi community who have advocated for a multipurpose sports field with a softball field overlay adjacent to the high school campus. Staff recommends Council consider all costs, risks, and benefits associated with each option and alternative  and provide direction to staff on how to proceed. For Council’s reference, a summary of options and alternatives is provided in Attachment H .  	Director David Martin, Director Susan Cline, Director Gigi Decavalles-Hughes	18
86	Adoption of the First Year and Approval of the Second Year of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2017-19 Biennial Budget, Adoption of the Second Year of the FY 2016-18 Biennial Capital Improvement Program Budget	Finance Department, Budget Division	This report presents information and requests actions necessary to adopt the first year of the FY 2017-19 biennial budget following the public hearings on the budget last month , including the second year of the FY 2016-18 Biennial Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Budget, for the City of Santa Monica, the Santa Monica Housing Authority and Santa Monica Parking Authority. It also requests that Council approve the operating budget plan for the second year of the Biennial Budget.  Since the City Charter requires Council to adopt a budget annually, staff will submit the FY  2018 ‑ 19 budget plan to Council for formal adoption, with any necessary revisions, in June 2018.  The City released its Proposed Budget for FY 2017-19 on May 16, 2017 and Council heard from individual departments and gave direction on specific priority areas at the Budget Study Sessions on May 23 and 24, 2017, resulting in the adjustments to the Proposed Budget recommended in this report. The Proposed Budget as revised is $774.9 million in FY  2017-18 and $80 2 . 8 million in FY 2018-19.  This report also includes actions necessary to revise certain fees, fines and parking rates and responds to Council queries and requests from the public hearings .  In this report, staff recommends continued funding to most Human Service Grants Program and Organizational Support Program grantee organizations at the FY 2016-17 funding levels, plus a 2.2% cost of living adjustment, and the acceptance of federal Continuum of Care Program renewal grant funds. 	On January 24, 2017 (Attachment M), Council reviewed and commented on the FY  2017-22 Five-Year Financial Forecast and directed staff to develop a fiscally sustainable budget.   During the two budget study sessions, held on May 23 and 24 (Attachment N), staff presented the May 2017 Financial Status Update for the General Fund for Fiscal Years 2017-22, as well as the FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget and Capital Improvement Program Budget for FY 2017-18. 	 The proposed two-year budget is balanced, with resources dedicated to maintaining the City’s core services and allocating new and repurposed funding to programs that reflect Council priorities. The Proposed Biennial Budget for the City of Santa Monica has been revised from the document presented to the public on May 16, 2017 to reflect final changes based on Council feedback and new information received. The Proposed Budget as revised is $774.9 million in FY 2017-18 and $80 2 . 8 million in FY 2018-19.  The May 23 and 24 Budget Study Sessions provided an opportunity for Councilmembers to ensure the Proposed Budget meets community needs. During the study sessions, Councilmembers directed staff to consider incorporating various changes to the proposed operating budget, and to provide additional information on certain items in time for the budget adoption public hearing on June  27,  2017. Requested information is included below and any relevant changes are included in the list of proposed final changes shown in Attachment D.  Vision Zero Council directed staff to assign a staff member dedicated to Vision Zero, an initiative seeking to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries. S taff proposes the creation of a two-year action plan that will be presented to Council for review by October 2017. Until then, staff has identified an interim staffing plan for a Vision Zero Coordinator. Staff in the Mobility Division of the Planning and Community Development Department will take on temporary assignments to allow a single coordinator to give interdepartmental leadership to all aspects of purs u ing Vision Zero.  Rather than spending new dollars on additional staffing at this time, s taff recommends that one-time funds of $500,000 be appropriated to the FY 2017-18 Proposed Budget for Vision Zero action plan projects that will occur over the next two years. Projects would include the installation of targeted physical improvements that would be complemented with other education, encouragement and enforcement efforts currently underway. Staff has developed a proposal to expend the funds based on a review of high-collision intersections, the Pedestrian Action Plan demand and crash analysis, community destinations and Council comments , as follows:   ·  Improve the Pico/Stewart crossing improvements with one curb extension and l ead p edestrian i nterval to increase pedestrian visibility and reduce exposure ($ 10 0,000) ·  Improve either the Santa Monica Boulevard/6th Street or Broadway/5th Street intersections with two curb extensions and lead pedestrian interval to increase visibility and reduce pedestrian exposure ($180,000) ·  Install Rapid Rectangular Flashing Beacons to increase vehicle yielding at two Wilshire intersections and two school locations ($ 12 0,000) ·  Pilot bicycle and pedestrian protections on Arizona Avenue at McKinley Elementary or similar location ($ 8 0,000) ·  Install l ead p edestrian i ntervals at 25 signalized intersections throughout Santa Monica (identified based on pedestrian volumes, crash history and adjacent community destinations) (Staff time cost) ·  Continue e nforcement and e ducation operations (Staff time cost)  Additional funds for capital investment in making all of Santa Monica streets safer for all users from the recently passed County Measure M and the additional local return of gas tax funds approved by Governor Brown and the State Legislature.  Using Data to Impact Service Delivery Council requested assurances that staff would begin applying the City’s new F ramework and performance management model to impact service delivery and budget decision-making. At its January 28, 2017 retreat (Attachment O), Council received staff’s report on a new organizational framework based on the dimensions of wellbeing and the Sustainable City Plan that would assist with creating a performance management system.    In response to Council’s direction, staff worked to better integrate sustainability and governance into the W ellbeing F ramework in preparation for the FY  2017-19 budget.  This refined F ramework, presented in the Proposed Budget, is built on the longstanding commitments and goals of the Sustainable City Plan and the baseline findings of the first Wellbeing I ndex from 2015.  Staff used the F ramework to organize budget proposals, prioritize budget requests and ultimately frame the FY  2017 ‑ 19 budget around its six outcome areas (community, place and planet, learning, health, economic opportunity and governance).   This fall, the next version of the Wellbeing Index will be released.  Over the coming year, findings from the next Index and goals from the Sustainable City Plan will be integrated into the F ramework.  This will establish meaningful goals and metrics to track the impact of City work efforts, including Council S trategic G oals.   Staff will engage a range of community partners to address issues of most concern to the community.  This summer there will be staff training on the next steps to launch the City’s new performance management process, Sa M oStat , beginning with its application to the Council’s Strategic Goals. The first SaMoStat meeting will be held in July, focusing on our regional efforts to reduce homelessness .  Reed Park Programming Council requested information on options to increase staff presence and activities at the newly-renovated Reed Park in order to maintain a safe, accessible and attractive open space. Staff spoke with Downtown Santa Monica, Inc. regarding extending the Ambassador Program to Reed Park but found it to be cost prohibitive. Siting Ambassadors at Reed Park, which is further from the Downtown core in which the Ambassadors operate, to provide daily hospitality services and restroom monitoring , would cost between $520,000 and $572,000 annually. Therefore,  at this time staff is focused on continuing to pursue a site-specific activation strategy of recreational, cultural, and enrichment programs, events, and activities for youth, families, adults, and seniors as well as a communication and outreach campaign.   As one means to increase programming in and activate Reed Park, staff will return to Council during the summer of 2017 with a proposed reduction to the current annual fee structure for fitness instruction, classes and camps operating in Reed Park and recommendations for a pilot program. Commercial fitness or athletic instruction, classes, or camps in City parks and on Santa Monica State Beach are currently subject to a Permit Fee, which was set by Council in 2013 at $100 and subject to annual CPI increases. An additional $50 Permit Fee is added if a n RFP, lottery or other allocation process is required to compensate for additional staff time. In addition to the Permit Fee(s), an annual charge  for use of the City parks and the Santa Monica State Beach is imposed: $1 , 800 for small group (not more than 2); $3,600 for medium group (not more than 10); $5,400 for large group (more than 10).  Currently, a 50% reduction in annual charge is applied for groups operating in Reed Park. Modifying the existing requirements further for Reed Park may incentivize use, potentially attracting new fitness instructors not currently under the permit system and/or entice current permitted instructors to re-loc ate to Reed Park.  Homeless Multi-disciplinary Street Team Council noted the need to continue funding the Homeless Multi-disciplinary Street Team (HMST), one of the “jump start” projects associated with the Addressing Homelessness Strategic Goal, which began operating in September 2016. The team consists of four full-time staff and a part-time psychiatrist through a contract with The People Concern, joined by medical staff from Venice Family Clinic, and provides care on the streets, in parks, jails and hospitals to the highest utilizers of City emergency services (police, fire, hospitals). It is funded through December 2017 with $300,000 in one-time  City of Santa Monica  funds.  Since the May 24, 2017 Budget Study Session, staff has learned that Supervisor Sheila Kuehl has agreed to provide $300,000 in discretionary funds to sustain the program through June 2018 and will consider an additional grant for the same amount for FY 2018-19 operations. City funding of $300,000 is requested to sustain the program through June  2019. The extension of the program would also allow for an assessment of “step down” interventions post-housing to determine how best to transition participants from HMST to other lower-intensity support services, thereby allowing the team to serve new individuals. Discussions are also underway to engage the business community to support this project as another on-going source of partial funding.  Staff is recommending that Council approve the transfer of $300,000 in General Fund “jump start” funding in FY 2018-19 to extend the program an additional year as a “proof of concept” project. This extension would result in  a strong, multi-year data set upon which to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention. As demonstrated by other evaluative tools such as the Wellbeing Index and the Youth Report Card, demonstrating social impact interventions requires consistent multi-year assessments to measure impact over time. RAND will evaluate the program, looking specifically at the effectiveness of the intervention for this highly vulnerable population and to see if the service model results in fewer contacts with local emergency services.  Social Safety Net Council expressed concern that the budget proposed by the Trump Administration c ould have severe impacts on the members of our community with the greatest need and fewest options.  While the federal budget is only a proposal at this point and is expected to undergo significant modification by Congress, the threat is sig nificant.  A preliminary review of FY 2016-17 funding sources for the 2 0 H uman S ervices G rants P rogram (HSGP) funded agencies indicates that they rely on $21 million in federal funding. This represents approximately 13% of the HSGP-funded agencies’ budgets. In addition, agencies report a $65 million reliance on other (state and local) government sources, portions of which could originate from federal sources, for an additional 40% of their agencies’ budgets. Staff is working with local agencies to project direct and indirect impacts of proposed safety net cuts at both the agency and community level. Staff will also coordinate with state and regional entities to avoid duplication of effort and ensure local funds are used to fill local gaps.  Among the programs slated for elimination are the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME programs. $201K of the City’s annual $1.03 million CDBG allocation is granted to the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles (LAFLA) ($80K), Westside Center for Independent Living (WCIL) ($36K), Chrysalis ($40K), and St. Joseph Center ($45K).  The Housing Division also uses CDBG for rehabilitation of 20 existing apartments per year where low-income households earning 80% of AMI reside. The HOME Program provides assistance totaling $437,000 to 16 households, and another 10 voucher holders are currently searching for apartments . The average monthly subsidy for all participants is over $15,000 .  Both of these grants also provide administrative funds to reimburse the City for the costs of administering the programs.  HUD’s Section 8 program provides a monthly housing subsidy to 995 households that totals over $11 million. A n  estimated $500,000 decrease in funding is possible with passage of the Trump Administration budget. If the budget is decreased by $500,000, approximately 100 households could lose their housing subsidies.  While more research is needed to assess grantee needs, staff estimates that the annual impact of the current budget proposal on the City’s programs could be approximately $1.5  million. Staff will continue to monitor budget negotiations in C ongress. Once a final federal budget is adopted, staff will confirm any impacts in Santa Monica, as well as potential options for addressing the local need.   Los Amigos Restrooms Council requested an update on progress to improve the area surrounding the Los Amigos restrooms. Staff is working with the contractor for the Los Amigos Cistern Project to remove the infield clay recently installed and replace it with decomposed granite. There was also a hose bib near the problematic location causing ponding that has been removed. The expectation is that these efforts will be sufficient to resolve the pathway issues. However, staff will continue to monitor the situation and if there are still issues at this location, staff will also obtain a cost estima te to install a concrete path.  Woodlawn Cemetery Council noted a need for increased maintenance along 17 th Street adjacent to Woodlawn Cemetery. There are currently 4 public litter containers on the west side of 17th Street between Delaware and Pico. Two of these containers were added in the past six months. There is room to add two more, one in a cut out area and the other near the fire hydrant. RRR staff will deliver two additional containers for a total of six.  Public Landscape renovated plantings along this stretch of 17th Street in March at the request of Councilmember Va z quez. As a part of this project a new irrigation system, plant materials and landscape mulch were installed (see Attachment P). The new plantings are being established and will ultimate ly fill in the landscaped area.  Proposed Budget Revisions Modifications to the Proposed Budget, known as final changes, are based on Council direction, new information and identified omissions. The changes increase the budget by $1. 2 million in FY 2017-18 and $ 0 . 7 million in FY 2018-19.  In FY 2017-18, the changes primarily reflect use of one-time funds to support Vision Zero projects, staffing adjustments,  and a n adjustment in the Wastewater Fund to reflect updated costs for shared use of the Hyperion Treatment Plant. In FY 2018-19, the changes primarily reflect ongoing costs for adjustments made in FY 2017-18.  An additional information-only change will be made to the capital improvement budget to reflect staff’s upcoming recommendation that the City issue lease revenue bonds for the construction of Fire Station 1 in FY 2017-18. The change from pay as you go funding to bond funding will take advantage of an optimal bond market. Staff will return to Council to request authorization to issue a bond at an appropriate time.  Staff recommends that Council adopt the changes to the FY 2017-18 Proposed Budget, and approve changes to the FY 2018-19 Proposed Budget. With these changes, the budget remains balanced. Changes are itemized in Attachment D.  Council Discretionary Funds Each year, Council allocates discretionary funds to assist the community in special projects or support important but otherwise unfunded priorities.  Traditionally, Council has supported community partners like the Business Improvement Districts, Santa Monica traditions like the Fourth of July Parade, one-time programs, and community students through science or music grants allowing Santa Monica youth to participate in special events. Allocation of the funds may occur along with Budget Adoption or throughout the year.  Including unprogrammed FY 2016-17 discretionary funds and FY 2017-18 discretionary funds, the Council has access to $553,762 in discretionary funds in FY 2017-18.  Fees/Fines/Rates During the budget study sessions, departments presented adjusted or new fees and rates that were included in the Proposed Budget and recommended in the comprehensive fee study. Staff anticipates that implementation of the fee study recommendations would result in approximately $1.2 million in additional revenue, $0.7  million of which is in the General Fund. As part of the adoption of the FY 2017-19 Budget, staff is presenting three fee/fine/rate related resolutions to Council for adoption. The master fee resolution (Attachment E) contains user fees and rates charged by the City ,  primarily fees analyzed in the recent fee study as well as new regulatory fees related to the City’s water neutrality ordinance. In addition, a master fine resolution (Attachment F) is being presented that includes all fines assessed by the City in one resolution. This includes administrative citation fines, parking violation fines, library fines, and fines for excessive responses to false alarms by the Police and Fire Departments. Two new non ‑ standard fines for violations of the Municipal Code related to tenant harassment have been added as well as a new Library fine for overdue teen laptop rentals. Finally, a comprehensive parking rate resolution (Attachment G) includes the recommended changes to beach parking rates presented during the budget study sessions , a pilot program for employees of businesses located in the downtown area , as well as a specific bulk parking fee for the California Judicial Council for one year to allow for the Council to address budget impacts resulting from the City not renewing its parking agreement with the Council in anticipation of the multipurpose sports field . The beach parking rate increase is set to take effect on November 1, 2017. Resolutions related to enterprises or mitigation fees  will continue to be separate and will be updated and presented to Council in the future as appropriate.  Personnel Changes As part of the budget process, proposed employee classification and compensation changes were reviewed by the Human Resources Department and the City Manager’s Office. The resulting classification and salary changes and position list are presented in Attachments H and I.  Budget Resolutions Adopting the resolutions in Attachments A, B, C would: 1.  Adopt the FY 2017-18 and approve the FY 2018-19 budget revenues at the account level, with operating expenditure appropriations for the Salaries and Wages and Supplies and Expenses (including Capital Outlay) major expenditure categories within a fund for each department, and capital improvement program budget within a fund; 2.  Authorize staff to roll over appropriations for multi-year operating grants not completed at the end of the fiscal year, unspent donations dedicated to programs, and the encumbrances for goods and services contracted for by FY  2016-17 year-end but not delivered or provided until FY 2017-18; 3.  Authorize staff to roll over appropriations for the General Fund and all other Non-General Fund unencumbered balances and unexpended encumbrances for the FY 2016-17 capital improvement program budget.  Gann Appropriations Limit State law places limits on the amount of Santa Monica’s General Fund appropriations that can be made without voter approval based on a growth factor calculated on changes in Santa Monica’s population and either State per capita personal income growth or the growth in non-residential assessed valuation. This restriction was placed in effect in November 1979 with the approval of Proposition 4, commonly known as the (Paul) Gann Initiative. The City’s Gann Appropriations Limit, based on growth in non-residential assessed valuation times the annual percentage population change for the City in FY 2017-18 is $2,013,078,428.  A comparison of the City’s FY 2017-18 Gann Appropriations Limit as set forth in the City’s Proposed FY 2017-18 Budget follows:  Proposed Gann Limit-related Spending for FY 2017-18 Gann Limit $2,013,078,428 Appropriations Subject to Limitation 256,590,386 Net (Over) Under $1,756,488,042   FY 2017-18 appropriations subject to limitation are $1,756,488,042 less than the City’s Gann Appropriations Limit. A resolution to establish the City’s FY 2017-18 Gann Appropriations Limit is included in Attachment J.  Human Services Grants Program (HSGP) and Organizational Support Program (OSP) for Santa Monica’s Arts and Culture Non-Profits The FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget includes continued funding to most grantee organizations at the FY 2016-17 funding levels, plus a 2.2% cost of living adjustment to the General Fund portion of each grant. The proposed budget also includes an enhancement to the HSGP in the amount of $173,500, which will increase grant funding for Connections for Children’s Santa Monica Early Education program. This program provides childcare subsidies to low- and moderate-income Santa Monica families with children up to kindergarten age. The increased funding will support an additional 10  program participants. Attachments K and L list the individual grantee agreements approved for funding through the FY 2015-19 Human Services Grants Program and Cultural Arts Organizational Support Program, along with the grant amounts for the FY  2017-18 Budget.  Acceptance of Federal Continuum of Care (CoC) Renewal Grants The Continuum of Care (CoC) Program is a Federally-funded competitive grant program that provides a housing subsidy (supportive housing) to chronically homeless, disabled households. On June 1, 2017, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded two Continuum of Care (CoC) grants in the amounts of $2,786,792 and $478,782. Staff is requesting authorization to accept the grant funds from HUD, for a one-year renewal. 	Director Donna Peter, Director Susan Cline	18

89	Contract Modification with Airwave Communications for Police Department Vehicle Upfitting	Public Works, Street & Fleet Services	The City replaces vehicles that have reached the end of their cost-effective useful life through the Vehicle Replacement Program. In the next two years,  87 Police Department vehicles are scheduled to be replaced through this program. The cost for installation of various standardized and specialized equipment for these vehicles , also known as “upfitting,” is approximately $13,500 each ,  based on the bids received and the current contract , which expires on October 27, 2017 .  A first modification to agreement # 9989 with Airwave Communications Enterprises to extend the term an additional two years , with no increase to the total contract  amount of $ 2,376,000 is necessary to provide upfitting services for planned purchases of  Police Department vehicles over the next two years . 	On October 28, 2014, Council awarded a contract to Airwave Communication Enterprises in an amount not to exceed $2,376,000 for labor and equipment associated with upfitting Police  Department vehicles (Attachment A). The term “upfitting” refers to the installation of various standardized and specialized equipment in or on a vehicle or piece of equipment , such as emergency lighting, warning equipment , computer equipment and/or a police radio.  At the time of the contract award staff estimated that 176 replacement police vehicles would require upfitting over the three - year term of the contract. However , only 71 Police Department vehicles have been replaced and upfit ted since then. Over the next two years, a n additional 87 Police Department vehicles are scheduled  to be replaced with new vehicles, which would require upfitting.  The City replaces vehicles that have reached the end of their cost-effective useful life through the Vehicle Replacement Program. As a part of the program, 87 Police Department vehicles are scheduled to be replaced during the next two years. Each new vehicle would be equipped with emergency lighting and warning equipment and a police radio. Some vehicles would be equipped with prisoner transport systems and additional equipment such as a mobile computer and camera system. The equipment installed in each vehicle varies depending on the purpose of the vehicle. Equipment from existing vehicles would be transferred to new vehicles when possible.  The process of equipping police vehicles is complex since there is significant equipment that must be installed to manufacturer specifications in order to operate properly in a rigorous mobile environment. Sensitive computer and camera equipment must be installed in a highly specialized manner in order to properly operate and last throughout its scheduled life cycle. 	On May 9 2017, Council approved the purchase of 26 Ford Police Interceptor Utility (PIU) Vehicles for the Police Department. The vehicles are scheduled for delivery in the next few months. If this modification is not approved, the 26 vehicles will be delivered and will sit, unused, until a formal bid is drafted, posted, and awarded by Council. This process may take from six to 12 months.  The 26 vehicles the PIUs are replacing have either been taken out of service or are not in good condition, which is why they were approved for replacement. The Police Department would be forced to continue to utilize the existing, older vehicles past their cost-effective useful life while their newly purchased PIUs sit unused waiting for upfitting. This could cause a variety of issues ranging from increased maintenance costs to vehicle accidents.  Any additional vehicles purchased for the Police Department over the next year may also sit unused while the formal bid is finalized.  Additional funding is not required as part of this contract modification . The addition of two years to the contract term would allow for uninterrupted service through October 27, 2019.  Vendor Selection In June 2014, the City published Notices Inviting Bids to provide labor and equipment associated with upfitting Police Department vehicles, as required by the Police Department and Fleet Management Division, in accordance with City specifications. The bid was posted on the City’s on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. The bid was downloaded by 19 vendors. Two bids were received and publicly opened on June 18, 2014 , per Attachment B.  Bids were evaluated on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, ability to deliver, completeness of bid response, past experience and quality of product. Airwave Communications Enterprises was the only bidder to provide a complete bid response including pricing for both labor and equipment as requested in the bid. The other bidder,  Adamson Police Products, did not provide pricing for installation/labor. Based on these criteria, Airwave Communications Enterprises was recommended as the best bidder to provide labor and equipment associated with upfitting Police Department vehicles.  By amending the contr act for an additional two years, the Police Department will continue to receive the high level of customer service and professionalism they have received from Airwave Communications Enterprises over the last few years. The amendment will also ensure that the type of equipment installed on the Police Department’s vehicles remains standardized, which assists Fleet Management when determining what parts to stock and the amount of training required for technicians to repair this type of equipment. 	\N	19
90	Options for the Removal of Excess Runway Pavement at Santa Monica Airport	Public Works, Civil Engineering	Santa Monica Airport (SMO) over the last century has grown from a dirt airstrip designed for biplanes to a busy general aviation airport with more than 80,000 landings and take-offs last year.  For the past three decades, the City government has sought to rein in the increasingly severe noise, health and safety impacts on surrounding neighborhoods.  After protracted litigation, the City of Santa Monica and the Federal government entered into a landmark Consent Decree to authorize permanent closure of SMO at the end of 2028.  The Consent also authorized the City t o shorten the Santa Monica Airport ’s runway by 40% to curb large jet operations.  Runway shortening construction is scheduled to be complete by the end of December.  The runway shortening creates more than 700’ feet of excess pavement on each end of the runway. At the May 24, 2017 special meeting, concurrent with selecting the preferred option for shortening the runway and adopting related CEQA actions, Council directed staff to investigate pavement removal options for the unused and abandoned portions of the runway, taxiways and adjacent in-field pavement that could be implemented as a separate and distinct project once the runway shortening project is complete.  Figure A below depicts the abandoned pavement that is potentially eligible for removal, and shows its relation to the Runway Protection Zone (RPZ) and Runway Safety Area (RSA). The RPZ is an area at ground level beyond the ends of the runway to enhance the safety and protection of people and property on the ground. For airports in urban areas, due to historical circumstances, the RPZ often extends beyond the airport boundary and into the surrounding neighborhood. The RSA is the surface immediately at each runway end prepared in a manner that reduces risk of damage to airplanes in the event of an undershoot, overshoot or excursion from the runway. At SMO the RSA extends 300 feet beyond the active runway. Figure A - Abandoned pavement removal options in relation to the RSA and RPZ  This report presents three options, listed below, for pavement removal for City Council’s consideration (see Figure A above and Attachment A, Figures 1 and 2 for reference).  These options involve removing unused pavement outside and within the RSA. ·  Option 1 - Remove all unused pavement outside the RSA and hydro-seed. Pulverize in place and stabilize pavement within the RSA ($3.44M) ·  Option 2 - Remove all unused pavement outside the RSA and install artificial turf. Pulverize in place and stabilize pavement within the RSA ($5.69M) ·  Option 3 - Pulverize in-place all unused pavement outside and within the RSA and stabilize ($2.73M)  Pavement removal areas under Options 1, 2, and 3 are partially within the RPZ. The RPZ is a very critical safety area th at should be kept free and clear of all objects in order to protect people and property. 	On February 28, 2017 (Attachment B), Council awarded Feasibility Professional Services Agreement 10436 (CCS) to AECOM, which engaged AECOM to study reducing the length of Runway 3-21 at SMO to 3,500 feet. The agreement included an initial feasibility phase to provide runway shortening options for Council consideration and future selection.  On April 24, 2017 (Attachment C), staff issued an Information Item responding to Council’s inquiry about a potential phased interim project for the removal of pavement at the ends of the runway and evaluation of future uses of the excess runway area. The Information Item provided an update on those topics, as well as the overall status of the runway-shortening project.  On May 24, 2017 (Attachment D), Council selected the center-aligned shortened runway option from the two options presented for runway shortening construction. At that meeting, Council also:  ·  Authorized staff to proceed with further design of the preferred option to establish a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) for a design-build agreement between the City and AECOM to complete runway-shortening construction prior to December 31, 2017; ·  Adopted Resolution No. 11044 stating that the runway-shortening project is categorically exempt from review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); and ·  Directed staff to investigate pavement removal options for the unused and abandoned portions o f the runway, taxiways and adjacent in-field pavement that could be implemented as a separate and distinct project once the runway shortening project is complete.  On August 8, 2017, (Attachment E), Council authorized the City manager to execute a design-build agreement with AECOM, for a GMP of $3.52 million to complete runway shortening construction by December 31, 2017. The City and AECOM are in the process of executing the Design-Build Agreement, with construction scheduled to begin in early October 2017 and be complete by the end of 2017 . 	The runway shortening project will result in 736 feet of unusable pavement for aircraft operations at each end of the runway. Of the 736 feet, the first 300 feet adjacent to each runway end is required for the Runway Safety Area (RSA).  The RSA must be well-graded with no ruts, humps or surface depressions and capable of supporting Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) equipment. Additionally, the first 150 feet of the RSA adjacent to each runway end, which includes the blast pad, must be essentially non-erodible under jet blasts to minimize the generation of Foreign Object Debris (FOD) that represent a major hazard to all aircraft.  Pavement Removal Options The existing runway pavement consists of approximately six inches of asphalt surface pavement over approximately eight inches of concrete pavement. The abandoned taxiways, shoulders and in-field areas consist of variable asphalt and concrete pavements ranging from three to eight inches thick.  Option 1 - Hydro-seeding ($3.44M) This option includes removing the abandoned pavement outside the RSA, backfilling and hydro-seeding the graded surface. The depth of excavation varies from three inches to thirteen inches, representing the full  thickness of the abandoned pavements, and would require minor grading and slope protection. This option also includes pulverizing in place the abandoned pavement within the RSA (Attachment A, Figures 1 and 2). The depth of pulverization is approximately thirteen inches, representing the full thickness of existing runway pavement. The pulverized pavement would be compacted, graded for drainage and stabilized with a soil stabilizer. Drainage improvements would likely be required for collecting storm water and to control excess storm water surface runoff from this area. Closure of the runway would be required during construction.  This option has less up-front costs, but potentially more on-going maintenance requirements. Scheduled maintenance of the hydro-seeded area would be required on an annual basis, supplemented by monthly or quarterly maintenance to control weeds and other vegetation. An irrigation system is not included in the estimate for this scenario. Even with the use of drought tolerant or native plants, to prevent dust from becoming an issue, periodic watering would be required. This option requires no imported fill material.   There is a risk that this option may attract wildlife , which is generally discouraged near airports .  Option 2- Artificial Turf ($5.69M) This option includes removing the abandoned pavement outside the RSA and installing artificial turf. The depth of excavation varies from three inches to thirteen inches, representing the full  thickness of the abandoned pavements. This option also includes pulverizing in place the abandoned pavement within the RSA (Attachment A, Figures 1 and 2). The depth of pulverization is approximately thirteen inches, representing the full thickness of existing runway pavement. The pulverized pavement would be compacted, graded for drainage and stabilized with a soil stabilizer. Closure of the runway would be required during construction.  This is the most expensive option initially, but requires less on-going maintenance. Nominal scheduled maintenance of the artificial turf including monthly vacuuming and grooming would be required . Artificial turf would be least susceptible to premature deterioration due to the elements. The d rainage improvements for collecting storm water and to control excess surface runoff contribute to the higher project cost. A downside to this option is the considerable number of truck trips generated by the amount of exported material generated and required imported fill.  Further, it is anticipated that this option would take the longest to construct by a couple of months.  Option 3 - Pulverizing In-Place ($2.73M) This option includes pulverizing in place the abandoned pavement outside and within the RSA (Attachment A, Figures 1 and 2). The depth of pulverization varies from three to thirteen inches representing the full thickness of the abandoned pavement. The pulverized pavement would be compacted, graded for drainage and stabilized with a soil stabilizer. Drainage improvements would likely be required to control excess storm water surface runoff from this area. It is anticipated that scheduled maintenance of the stabilized area would be required on an annual basis, with ongoing maintenance to control weeds, between the scheduled maintenance. Closure of the runway would be required during construction.  This is the least expensive option and requires no exporting or importing of material.  Additionally, this option will likely have the shortest construction duration.  This option requires as-needed maintenance to re-compact and stabilize the surface in order to maintain its integrity. This results in the highest maintenance costs of the three options.  For all three options, t o conform to FAA requirements, the pulverized pavement within the RSA would be well-graded with no ruts, humps or surface depressions and would be capable of supporting Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting equipment and the occasional passage of aircraft without causing damage to the aircraft. The initial 150 feet at each end of the shortened runway (representing the runway blast pad areas) would be resurfaced with asphaltic material, conforming to FAA requirements that the runway blast pad area shall be non-erodible under jet blasts to minimize the danger of debris ( FOD ) . All excavated areas would need to be backfilled, graded and compacted prior to the opening of the runway. All runway threshold lights, runway end lights and signs would need to be restored and operational at the end of each working shift.  Anticipated Schedule Staff anticipates the following completion schedule for implementing any of the three pavement removal options, based on the City's design-bid-build procurement process.  ·  Procure Design Services - January 2017 ·  Final Design Completion - April 2018 ·  Construction Award - August 2018 ·  Construction Completion - February 2019  California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Determination It has been determined that removal of t he excess runway pavement at Santa Monica Airport (SMO) would be categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to Sections 15301 and 15304 of CEQA Guidelines. Section 15301 provides a Class 1 exemption for the minor alteration of existing public or private facilities involving negligible or no expansion of use. Section 15304 provides a Class 4 exemption for minor public or private alterations in the condition of land and/or vegetation. The project would make improvements to existing un-useable pavement at SMO, which will include the removal of existing pavement and the installation of a stable surface (artificial turf, hydro-seeded soil and mulch, ground-in-place and stabilized pavement, etc.). Therefore, the project qualifies as a Class 1 and Class 4 exemption. In addition, none of the exceptions specified in Section 15300.2 of CEQA Guidel ines would apply that would preclude the use of this CEQA exemption - the project site is not located in a sensitive environment, the project will not have a significant effect on the environment, the project would not damage scenic resources, the project would not be located on a hazardous waste site; and the project would not cause a change to a historical resource. Therefore,  this project is determined to be categorically exempt from CEQA. 	\N	19

92	Approval of Sanitary Sewer System Master Plan	Public Works, Water Resources	The 2017 Sanitary S ewer System Master Plan (SSSMP) (Attachment A) provide s the City with a tool for planning sanitary sewer collection system infrastructure improvements. The primary purpose of this Master Plan is to evaluate the capacity of the City’s existing sanitary sewer system under current conditions and plan for the capacity required by future conditions associated with anticipated development projects, including the Land Use and Circulation Element ( LUCE ) and the Downtown Community Plan (DCP). In order to analyze the impacts of existing and future sewer flows, a numerical hydraulic model was developed. The analysis found that the City’s sewer system performs well under both existing and future conditions. Existing conditions show a 1% shortfall in sewer flow capacity citywide, and under future build out conditions, only 3% of the modeled pipelines exhibited a capacity deficiency.   The ability of the sewer collection system to meet future conditions with only modest investments in sewer upgrades paid for by development fees means these improvements can be incorporated into the City’s existing $3 million per year sewer main replacement Capital Improvement Program forecas t , as presented below. 	Santa Monica’s wastewater system includes  a collection system including gravity sewers, force mains, monitoring stations and a lift station to help convey sewage to the City of Los Angeles’ Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant in El Segundo for treatment and disposal . The City’s sanitary sewer facilities include approximately 152 miles of pipelines, 2,800 maintenance holes, two permanent flow monitoring and sampling stations , and one 26 - million - gallons - per - day (MGD) pumping station, referred to as the Moss Avenue Pump Station (MAPS) , located at 1623 Appian Way . The City’s sanitary sewer system is shown i n Figure 1. Prior studies include d the development of a limited model assessing the capacity of the trunk sewer used to discharge brine (the wastewater produced as a by-product of potable water treatment process) from the City’s water treatment plant into the sewer system at 19 th and Broadway (2011), and a Sewer System Management Plan (2012) which addressed sewer system organization and management, operations and maintenance, overflow response plans , and water quality monitoring programs.  The last comprehensive Sewer Master Plan for the system was conducted in 1992. The findings and recommendations of the 1992 Master Plan were mostly not implemented, however, as the 1994 Northridge Earthquake caused considerable damage to the sewer system, after which approximately 80% of the system was rebuilt and rehabilitated.

The Downtown Community Plan EIR includes mitigation measure MM U-4 which states : “In addition to the improvements to the water delivery system described in the MM U-1, the City shall ensure adequate financing for funding of infrastructure improvements to the wastewater system. The DPIFP described in MM U-1 shall determine the costs of and establish a funding program for the following capital improvements to wastewater conveyan c e as needed to serve the demands of new projects occurring under the Downtown Community Plan.”  The primary purpose of this planning document is to evaluate the capacity of the City’s sanitary sewer system under current conditions and plan for any necessary improvements in capacity to accommodate anticipated new development in the City. These improvements would be implemented within the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP).  To fully assess existing conditions in the sewer collection system and plan for the future capacity needs of the sanitary sewer system, future flow estimates incorporate the changes in sanitary flows that would be generated by anticipated development  and the additional water that enters the sewer system from storm-related events . The additional sanitary sewer flow s associated with these development projects are derived by apply ing the applicable sewer discharge factors for the land use types and densities of each planned development project. Future development projects and their status in the development process are depicted graphically on Figure 2. Based on these factors, future average dry weather flows are projected to increase from 14.4 million to 16.5 million gallons per day (MGD), an increase of approximately 14 percent. About half of this increase is projected to occur in the downtown area .  Recent and near - term actions planned by the City continue to support the City’s sustainability goals and minimize the projected increase of sewage generation related to new development in the City . Foremost among these programs is the recently adopted Water Neutrality Ordinance and the programmatic efforts of the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP). Each of these programs will help in reducing the projected overall increase in sewer flows and are summarized below.  Water Neutrality In May 2017, the Santa Monica City Council adopted a Water Neutrality Ordinance to require that new development offset water use on site or off site, or alternately, pay the City an in-lieu fee to fund retrofitting of plumbing fixtures offsite. The ordinance would prohibit a new development from exceed ing the water use of the existing development on that property. If that requirement could not be met onsite, the excess water demand would have to be offset by reducing the water demand (through fixture replacement) at other sites within the City. Given this water neutrality requirement, much if not all of the projected overall increase in future sewage flow should be offset through this growth - funded plumbing fixture retrofit program.    It should be noted that while this water neutrality program may offset an increase in overall sewage flows, Water Neutrality may  still allow for an increase in flows at any specific site. With this program provision, some of the large future developments could still have a substantial point load increase in sewage discharges. To plan for this potential increase associated with these developments and to assure adequate capacity in the sanitary sewer system collection system network, the impact of site specific increases has been incorporated in the hydraulic model. Proceeding in this manner, the assessment included some anticipated impact from new development to reduce the risk of sanitary sewer overflows .  SWIP – Water Reclamation Facility (WRF) The City of Santa Monica Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP) will provide for the treatment and reuse of brackish/saline impaired groundwater, recycled municipal wastewater and stormwater runoff. In addition, the SWIP will help improve the water quality in the Santa Monica Bay by reducing urban runoff into the Bay.   The Water Reclamation Facility (WRF) component of the SWIP will have the greatest benefit to the City’s sanitary sewer system . The WRF will remove 1 MGD of sewage from the sewer collection system in the area .  This will provide additional pipeline capacity and reduce the cost of wastewater treatment and disposal currently charged by the City of Los Angeles.  Assessment Modeling To support the evaluation of the City’s sanitary sewer system for both existing and future conditions, a hydraulic model was developed. The hydraulic model development activities included a comprehensive review of system data including Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping, Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA), NorthStar billing system statistics, sewer flow analysis and allocation, elevation extraction for the model facilities based on survey data, diurnal (daytime/nighttime) pattern assignments, analysis of dry and wet weather peaking factors and model calibration based on flow monitoring data.  The calibrated sanitary sewer system hydraulic model was used to perform a comprehensive capacity analysis of the sewer system under current and future conditions. These modeling simulations determined the adequacy of the system capacity under dry weather and wet weather conditions, and subsequently identified parts of the systems where improvements will be required for anticipated development. The analysis found that the City’s sanitary sewer system performs exceedingly well , and there are very limited areas where the hydraulic capacity of the existing sewer system may fall short of the applicable evaluation criteria . These evaluation criteria comprise two factors used in sewer flow analysis in pipelines: ·  depth of flow equal to or less than half of the pipe diameter ; and ·  average flow velocity equal to or greater than 2 feet per second. For maintenance hole performance, surcharge relates to th e depth of wastewater in the maintenance hole relative to the street elevation in the event of a sewage backup.   Under existing conditions, approximately 1% of the system may experience a capacity shortfall. In utilizing the model to simulate future conditions, the City’s sewer system continues to perform well. In fact, under future conditions, only 3% of the modeled pipelines exceeded the evaluation depth of flow criteria (depth of flow greater than half of the pipe diameter) . Although 1% existing and 3% future capacity shortfall  results represent a favorable outcome of this analysis, any Sanitary Sewer Overflow which occurs can become an environmental hazard to the coastal environment. By addressing problem areas proactively, spills may be prevented and hazards avoided.  The condition of the existing system and its ability to address future conditions with relatively modest investment lead to a proposed 5-year Capital I mprovement Program .  The annual expenditures in the proposed CIP coincide with historical $3 million per year sewer main replacement budgets.  In addressing needed improvements in the immediate five-year planning horizon, capacity to serve future conditions  will be in place in advance of  the build-out of  the DCP/LUCE. The proposed five-year CIP schedule is provided below.       Capacity Improvements $2,000,000 $1,200,000 $1,600,000  $2,000,000 Field Review Services $100,000   $80,000  Pipeline Replacements $900,000 $1,800,000 $1,400,000 $2,920,000 $1,000,000 TOTAL ANNUAL CIP $3,000,000 $3,000,000 $3,000,000 $3,000,000 $3,000,000  Capacity improvements are those projects identified in the SSSMP , which were found through the hydraulic modeling to be in need of replacement due to insufficient capacity to meet existing and/or future conditions. Field review services include projects or activities that are needed to further refine the sewer system hydraulic model from additional field investigations, in the form of facility information validation or flow verification, to confirm pipeline and maintenance hole data and obtain new information on actual sewer flow conditions in various areas of the City. The results of this effort may enable the City to reduce the identified capacity-related improvements provided herein. Pipeline replacements include those pipelines identified through ongoing maintenance activities ( e.g., sewer jetting and video inspections) for the annual sewer main replacement program. 	\N	19
93	Establishment of Preferential Parking Zone SS on portions of Virginia Avenue, Kansas Avenue, 27th Street, Stewart Street, and Frank Street, and adoption of a Resolution establishing Preferential Parking Regulations.	Mobility (PCD)	Residents of the 2000 block of Stewart Street have submitted a qualifying petition for preferential parking regulations in accordance with City policies . The residents assert that non-resident parking is impacting their ability to find parking near their homes. A parking study conducted in November and December of 2016 confirmed that street parking on unregulated streets in the area has high usage during the evening and high to moderate usage during the day for both the weekend and weekday.  Staff recommends creating Preferential Parking Zone SS, approving the following preferential parking regulations for the following blocks:  Virginia Avenue between Cloverfield Boulevard and 27 th Street, Kansas Avenue between Cloverfield Boulevard and Stewart Street, 27 th Street between Virginia Avenue and Kansas Avenue, Stewart Street between Kansas Avenue and the Santa Monica Freeway, and Frank Street between Virginia and the Santa Monica Freeway with the regulation “No parking 6 P.M. to 7 A.M., 2 hour parking 7 A.M. to 6 P.M., daily, except by permit”.  Should Council approve the recommended action it is estimated that permit sales for the 2000 block of Stewart Street, the only block that has completed a petition to date, would generate revenues of approximately $1,600 annually, which would offset, but not fully recover, the cost to the City of issuing permits to residents. Additionally, new signage would be required at an estimated one-time cost of $800. 	The City uses p referential parking a s a tool to manage non-resident parking use on residential streets, as authorized by Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 3.08 and the California Vehicle Code. Preferential parking regulations manage the use of on-street parking to make parking more available for residents near their home. Only residents who live on a block with preferential parking restrictions are eligible to purchase a permit. Permits may be used within two block faces of the permit holder’s address.  Residents may petition to initiate a preferential parking zone at any time. Upon receipt of a petition representing two-thirds of the residential units on a block, a parking occupancy study of the neighborhood is conducted and a community meeting is held. In evaluating the petitions, staff typically evaluates the larger neighborhood, rather than an individual block due to the potential for parking displacement when regulations are established or changed. As a result, staff typically recommends that the Council pre-approve preferential parking regulations for more than one block to streamline and expedite the process for adjacent blocks should some displacement occur. SMMC 3.08.030 provides Council with the authority to create preferential parking zones.  Once Council approves preferential parking regulations, they are implemented on the block or blocks that have submitted qualifying petitions. Preferential parking regulations are not implemented on blocks that have been pre-approved by the Council until residents of those blocks submit qualifying petitions representing two-thirds of the residential units on the block. 	 The residents of Stewart Street between Kansas Avenue and the Santa Monica Freeway have submitted a complete petition requesting to install preferential parking regulations. The surrounding area includes: ·  to the east of Stewart Street Preferential Parking Zone PP “No parking 8AM-9PM daily, except by permit”,  ·  to the west on Cloverfield Boulevard near Santa Monica College, Zone L “No parking 8AM-8PM Mon-Thurs, 8AM-5PM Fri, except by permit”, and  ·  to the south of Pico Boulevard Zone DD with the regulations “2 Hour parking 8AM-6PM daily, except by permit” and “No parking 8AM-6PM daily, except by permit.” There are several different types of regulations in Zone DD. The regulations cited are the ones south of Pico Boulevard closest to the proposed new zone.  The existing area regulations and petition blocks are shown in Attachment B Existing and Proposed Parking Regulations .  Parking demand in the area is high due to its dense residential nature as well as its proximity to the business district on Pico Boulevard. The area is anchored by the Edison Language Academy, and also includes the preschool and infant care center Les Enfants. A street parking occupancy survey was conducted in November and December 2016 for both weekend and weekday time periods from 7 A.M. to 10 P.M. A summary of the data is included as Attachment C Parking Study . Key findings of the study are: ·  there was a similar street parking occupancy pattern for both the weekend and weekday with the highest street parking usage for both periods occurring during the evening from 6 P.M. to 10 P.M.;  ·  street parking usage was consistently higher during the weekend period with the highest parking usage overall occurring on the weekend during the time period 8 P.M. to 10 P.M.; during this time period all street parking was almost completely used with parking occupancy at or above 90% on all streets in the study area; and  ·  the lowest parking occupancy occurred during the late morning and midday period with parking occupancies at or below 80%. There would typically be at least one or two open parking spaces available on each block during this time period.  The data indicat es street parking is particularly difficult to find during the evening when the majority of residents return home and that open street parking spaces while not plentiful are more consistently available during the midday period.  Public Outreach Residents, businesses, property owners, and the neighborhood organization were notified of the proposed preferential parking zone by mail and invited to a March 29, 2017 community meeting to discuss preferential parking. A listing of the comments received at the meet ing, and by email and mail is included as Attachment D Community Comments . A summary of the major issues stated at the meeting are listed below: ·  general consensus from the community that street parking is difficult to find in the area, particularly durin g the evening period, and the majority of the attendees were in support of preferential parking regulations;  ·  residents expressed concern that the grocery store which recently opened at the corner of Cloverfield Boulevard and Pico Boulevard would increas e non-resident use of street parking and make it more difficult for residents to park;  ·  the Pico Neighborhood Association stated its support for strict preferential parking regulations that would include overnight parking regulations; and   ·  the repr esentative from the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District expressed a preference for allowing limited time non-permit parking during the day to facilitate pickup and drop-off at the Edison L anguage Academy and to maintain access to the shared playgrounds at the school which are open to the community.  Recommended Preferential Parking Regulations Based on the parking occupancy study which showed high usage of street parking in the evening period staff recommends evening and overnight permit parking regulations. To achieve the goals of improving street parking availability for residents while maintaining short-term street parking accessibility to the Edison Language Academy and Les Enfants Preschool and Infant Care staff recommends allowing limited time non-permit parking during the day. The recommended preferential parking would consist of the following blocks and regulations: ·  Virginia Avenue between Cloverfield Boulevard and 27 th Street, Kansas Avenue between Cloverfield Boulevard and Stewart Street, 27 th Street between Virginia Avenue and Kansas Avenue, Stewart Street between Kansas Avenue and the Santa Monica Freeway, and F rank Street between Virginia and the Santa Monica Freeway with the regulation “No parking 6 P.M. to 7 A.M., 2 hour parking 7 A.M. to 6 P.M., daily, except by permit”. The Edison Language Academy passenger loading areas adjacent to the school would be maintained on Kansas and Virginia Avenue.  Environmental Analysis The proposed project has been determined to be categorically exempt from the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), pursuant to Article 19, Section 15301 (c) which defines Class 1 exempt projects in the following way: “Class 1 consists of the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agency’s determination.” The exemption includes: “Existing highways and streets, sidewalks, gutters, bicycle and pedestrian trails, and similar facilities.” Preferential parking zones involve only the issuance of permits for the use of an existing public street and include negligible or no expansion of the existing use.  Next Steps If preferential parking regulations are approved regulations would be installed on the 2000 block of Stewart Street within approximately eight weeks. This allows time for: residents to apply for permits, staff to process applications, signs to be ordered, manufactured, and installed, and a grace period between the installation of signs and the enforcement of preferential parking regulations. Additional blocks within the zone would have preferential parking implemented approximately eight weeks after receipt of a qualifying petition signed by residents representing two-thirds of the residential units of that block. Staff have identified strategies to assist residents in gathering signatures for the longer blocks in the area (ex. Kansas Avenue), which require a significant amount of signatures to meet the qualifying petition criteria. The approval of Preferential Parking Zone SS would generate $1,600 in ongoing revenues from the sale of an estimated 58 new resident and visitor permits. The anticipated revenue increase will be adjusted during the FY 2017-18 mid-year budget. Funds for the one-time cost related to the purchase of new signage for Preferential Parking Zone SS totaling $800 are included in the FY 2017-18 b udget in the Planning and Community Development Department. 	\N	19
